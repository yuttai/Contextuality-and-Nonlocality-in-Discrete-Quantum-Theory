  abstract    = {In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies with time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus, techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one may impair performance. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the system. The tool whose use we advocate is random-set theory (RST): applying this, we derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters comprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive Bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a posteriori probability (APP) density of the unknown user parameters, and use this density to derive optimum detectors. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to interferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.},

  abstract     = {We pursue a model-oriented rather than axiomatic approach to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, with the idea that new models can often suggest new axioms. This approach has often been fruitful in Logic and Theoretical Computer Science. Rather than seeking to construct a simplified toy model, we aim for a `big toy model', in which both quantum and classical systems can be faithfully represented - as well as, possibly, more exotic kinds of systems. To this end, we show how Chu spaces can be used to represent physical systems of various kinds. In particular, we show how quantum systems can be represented as Chu spaces over the unit interval in such a way that the Chu morphisms correspond exactly to the physically meaningful symmetries of the systems - the unitaries and antiunitaries. In this way we obtain a full and faithful functor from the groupoid of Hilbert spaces and their symmetries to Chu spaces. We also consider whether it is possible to use a finite value set rather than the unit interval; we show that three values suffice, while the two standard possibilistic reductions to two values both fail to preserve fullness.},

We use an isomorphism between non-additive measures on the original space (of states of the world) and additive ones on a larger space (of events), and embed the space of real-valued functions on the former in the corresponding space on the latter. This embedding gives rise to the following results: • the Choquet integral with respect to any totally monotone capacity is an average over minima of the integrand; • the Choquet integral with respect to any capacity is the difference between minima of regular integrals over sets of additive measures; • under fairly general conditions one may define a ‘Radon-Nikodym derivative’ of one capacity with respect to another; • the ‘optimistic’ pseudo-Bayesian update of a non-additive measure follows from the Bayesian update of the correspo},

  abstract  = {Information is inevitably tied to a physical representation and therefore to restrictions and possibilities related to the laws of physics and the parts available in the universe. Quantum mechanical superpositions of information bearing states can be used, and the real utility of that needs to be understood. Quantum parallelism in computation is one possibility and will be assessed pessimistically. The energy dissipation requirements of computation, of measurement and of the communications link are discussed. The insights gained from the analysis of computation has caused a reappraisal of the perceived wisdom in the other two fields. A concluding section speculates about the nature of the laws of physics, which are algorithms for the handling of information, and must be executable in our real physical universe. },

  year         = {2015},
  abstract     = {To make precise the sense in which nature fails to respect classical physics, one requires a formal notion of classicality. Ideally, such a notion should be defined operationally, so that it can be subjected to a direct experimental test, and it should be applicable in a wide variety of experimental scenarios, so that it can cover the breadth of phenomena that are thought to defy classical understanding. Bell's notion of local causality fulfills the first criterion but not the second. The notion of noncontextuality fulfills the second criterion, but it is a long-standing question whether it can be made to fulfill the first. Previous attempts to experimentally test noncontextuality have all presumed certain idealizations that do not hold in real experiments, namely, noiseless measurements and exact operational equivalences. We here show how to devise tests that are free of these idealizations. We also perform a photonic implementation of one such test that rules out noncontextual models with high confidence.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a discrete model theory similar in structure to ordinary quantum mechanics, but based on a finite field instead of complex amplitudes. The interpretation of this theory involves only the \textquotedblleft{}modal\textquotedblright concepts of possibility and necessity rather than quantitative probability measures. Despite its simplicity, our model theory includes entangled states and has versions of both Bell\textquoteright{}s theorem and the no cloning theorem}

A convex game is defined as one that is based on a convex set function. In this paper it is shown that the core of a convex game is not empty and that it has an especially regular structure. It is further shown that certain other cooperative solution concepts are related in a simple way to the core: The value of a convex game is the center of gravity of the extreme points of the core, and the von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set solution of a convex game is unique and coincides with the core.},

Most notably, we show that there is no Kochen-Specker coloring of the $n \times n$ idempotent integer matrices for $n \geq 3$, thereby illustrating that Kochen-Specker contextuality is an inherent feature of pure matrix algebra. We apply this to generalize recent no-go results on noncommutative spectrum functors, showing that any contravariant functor from rings to sets (respectively, topological spaces or locales) that restricts to the Zariski prime spectrum functor for commutative rings must assign the empty set (respectively, empty space or locale) to the matrix ring $M_n(R)$ for any integer $n \geq 3$ and any ring $R$. An appendix by Alexandru Chirvasitu shows that Kochen-Specker colorings of idempotents in partial subalgebras of $M_3(F)$ for a perfect field $F$ can be extended to partial algebra morphisms into the algebraic closure of $F$.},

  abstract    = {This article summarizes the Quantum Bayesian point of view of quantum mechanics, with special emphasis on the view's outer edges---dubbed QBism. QBism has its roots in personalist Bayesian probability theory, is crucially dependent upon the tools of quantum information theory, and most recently, has set out to investigate whether the physical world might be of a type sketched by some false-started philosophies of 100 years ago (pragmatism, pluralism, nonreductionism, and meliorism). Beyond conceptual issues, work at Perimeter Institute is focused on the hard technical problem of finding a good representation of quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities, without amplitudes or Hilbert-space operators. The best candidate representation involves a mysterious entity called a symmetric informationally complete quantum measurement. Contemplation of it gives a way of thinking of the Born Rule as an addition to the rules of probability theory, applicable when an agent considers gambling on the consequences of his interactions with a newly recognized universal capacity: dimension (formerly Hilbert-space dimension). (The word "capacity" should conjure up an image of something like gravitational mass---a body's mass measures its capacity to attract other bodies. With hindsight one can say that the founders of quantum mechanics discovered another universal capacity, "dimension.") The article ends by showing that the egocentric elements in QBism represent no impediment to pursuing quantum cosmology and outlining some directions for future work.},

  abstractnote = {Launchbury and Peyton Jones came up with an ingenious idea for embedding regions of imperative programming in a pure functional language like Haskell. The key idea was based on a simple modification of Hindley-Milner’s type system. Our first contribution is to propose a more natural encapsulation construct exploiting higher-order kinds, which achieves the same encapsulation effect, but avoids the ad hoc type parameter of the original proposal. The second contribution is a type safety result for encapsulation of strict state using both the original encapsulation construct and the newly introduced one. We establish this result in a more expressive context than the original proposal, namely in the context of the higher-order lambda-calculus. The third contribution is a type safety result for encapsulation of lazy state in the higher-order lambda-calculus. This result resolves an outstanding open problem on which previous proof attempts failed. In all cases, we formalize the intended implementations as simple big-step operational semantics on untyped terms, which capture interesting implementation details not captured by the reduction semantics proposed previously.},

  abstract    = {In recent work, Benjamin Schumacher and Michael~D. Westmoreland investigate a version of quantum mechanics which they call "modal quantum theory" but which we prefer to call "discrete quantum theory". This theory is obtained by instantiating the mathematical framework of Hilbert spaces with a finite field instead of the field of complex numbers. This instantiation collapses much the structure of actual quantum mechanics but retains several of its distinguishing characteristics including the notions of superposition, interference, and entanglement. Furthermore, discrete quantum theory excludes local hidden variable models, has a no-cloning theorem, and can express natural counterparts of quantum information protocols such as superdense coding and teleportation. Our first result is to distill a model of discrete quantum computing from this quantum theory. The model is expressed using a monadic metalanguage built on top of a universal reversible language for finite computations, and hence is directly implementable in a language like Haskell. In addition to superpositions and invertible linear maps, the model includes conventional programming constructs including pairs, sums, higher-order functions, and recursion. Our second result is to relate this programming model to relational programming, e.g., a pure version of Prolog over finite relations. Surprisingly discrete quantum computing is identical to conventional logic programming except for a small twist that is responsible for all the ``quantum-ness.'' The twist occurs when merging sets of answers computed by several alternatives: the answers are combined using an "exclusive" version of logical disjunction. In other words, the two branches of a choice junction exhibit an "interference" effect: an answer is produced from the junction if it occurs in one or the other branch but not both.},

In the theory of radioactive disintegration, as presented by Gamow, the α-particle is represented by a spherical wave which slowly leaks out of the nucleus. On the other hand, the α-particle, once emerged, has particle-like properties, the most striking being the ray tracks that it forms in a Wilson cloud chamber.

  abstract = {We pursue a model-oriented rather than axiomatic approach to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, with the idea that new models can often suggest new axioms. This approach has often been fruitful in Logic and Theoretical Computer Science. Rather than seeking to construct a simplified toy model, we aim for a `big toy model', in which both quantum and classical systems can be faithfully represented---as well as, possibly, more exotic kinds of systems. To this end, we show how Chu spaces can be used to represent physical systems of various kinds. In particular, we show how quantum systems can be represented as Chu spaces over the unit interval in such a way that the Chu morphisms correspond exactly to the physically meaningful symmetries of the systems---the unitaries and antiunitaries. In this way we obtain a full and faithful functor from the groupoid of Hilbert spaces and their symmetries to Chu spaces. We also consider whether it is possible to use a finite value set rather than the unit interval; we show that three values suffice, while the two standard possibilistic reductions to two values both fail to preserve fullness.},

  abstract  = {Quantum computers are unnecessary for exponentially efficient computation or simulation if the Extended Church-Turing thesis is correct. The thesis would be strongly contradicted by physical devices that efficiently perform tasks believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is boson sampling: sampling the output distributions of n bosons scattered by some passive, linear unitary process. We tested the central premise of boson sampling, experimentally verifying that three-photon scattering amplitudes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a six-mode integrated optical circuit. We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection. Scaling this to large numbers of photons should be a much simpler task than building a universal quantum computer.},

  abstract  = {The Born rule, a foundational axiom used to deduce probabilities of events from wavefunctions, is indispensable in the everyday practice of quantum physics. It is also key in the quest to reconcile the ostensibly inconsistent laws of the quantum and classical realms, as it confers physical significance to reduced density matrices, the essential tools of decoherence theory. Following Bohr’s Copenhagen interpretation, textbooks postulate the Born rule outright. However, recent attempts to derive it from other quantum principles have been successful, holding promise for simplifying and clarifying the quantum foundational bedrock. A major family of derivations is based on envariance, a recently discovered symmetry of entangled quantum states. Here, we identify and experimentally test three premises central to these envariance-based derivations, thus demonstrating, in the microworld, the symmetries from which the Born rule is derived. Further, we demonstrate envariance in a purely local quantum system, showing its independence from relativistic causality.},

Thus, some hidden variable programs aim to retain noncontextuality at the cost of using a generalization of the Kolmogorov probability axioms. We generalize a theorem of Feintzeig (Br J Philos Sci 66(4): 905--927, 2015) to show that such programs are committed to the existence of a finite null cover for some quantum mechanical experiments, i.e., a finite collection of probability zero events whose disjunction exhausts the space of experimental possibilities.},

Original proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem proceeded via brute force counter-examples; often quite complicated and subtle (albeit mathematically "elementary") counter-examples. Only more recently have somewhat more "geometrical" proofs been developed. We present herein yet another simplified geometrical proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem, one that is valid for any number of dimensions, that minimizes the technical machinery involved, and makes the seriousness of the issues raised manifest.},

  abstract  = {The framework of generalized probabilistic theories is a powerful tool for studying the foundations of quantum physics. It provides the basis for a variety of recent findings that significantly improve our understanding of the rich physical structure of quantum theory. This review paper tries to present the framework and recent results to a broader readership in an accessible manner. To achieve this, we follow a constructive approach. Starting from a few basic physically motivated assumptions we show how a given set of observations can be manifested in an operational theory. Furthermore, we characterize consistency conditions limiting the range of possible extensions. In this framework classical and quantum theory appear as special cases, and the aim is to understand what distinguishes quantum mechanics as the fundamental theory realized in nature. It turns out that non-classical features of single systems can equivalently result from higher-dimensional classical theories that have been restricted. Entanglement and non-locality, however, are shown to be genuine non-classical features.},

As an application, the theory extends the relevant work of Lieb and Araki to positive linear forms of arbitrary *-algebras. In this context a ``relative entropy'' is defined for every pair of positive linear forms of a *-algebra with identity. For this generalized relative entropy its joint convexity and its decreasing under identity-preserving completely positive maps is proved.},

I show that the joint distribution of any non-commuting pair of variables can be quantified via upper and lower probabilities, i.e. the joint probability is described by an interval instead of a number (imprecise probability). I propose transparent axioms from which the upper and lower probability operators follow. The imprecise probability depend on the non-commuting observables, is linear over the state (density matrix) and reverts to the usual expression for commuting observables.},

The single-qubit Hilbert space is the three-dimensional sphere S 3 . The S 2 base space of a suitably oriented S 3 Hopf fibration is nothing but the Bloch sphere, while the circular fibres represent the overall qubit phase degree of freedom. For the two-qubits case, the Hilbert space is a seven-dimensional sphere S 7 , which also allows for a Hopf fibration, with S 3 fibres and a S 4 base. The most striking result is that suitably oriented S 7 Hopf fibrations are entanglement sensitive. The relation with the standard Schmidt decomposition is also discussed.},

Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: {\textquoteleft}every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means{\textquoteright}. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the {\textquoteleft}universal quantum computer{\textquoteright} are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include {\textquoteleft}quantum parallelism{\textquoteright}, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett{\textquoteright}s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the {\textquoteleft}complexity{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}knowledge{\textquoteright} in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

  abstract = {This paper shows how the classical finite probability theory (with equiprobable outcomes) can be reinterpreted and recast as the quantum probability calculus of a pedagogical or toy model of quantum mechanics over sets (QM/sets). There have been several previous attempts to develop a quantum-like model with the base field of                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}C{\}}{\}} {\$}{\$}                                                      C                                                 replaced by                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            Z                      2                                                                    . Since there are no inner products on vector spaces over finite fields, the problem is to define the Dirac brackets and the probability calculus. The previous attempts all required the brackets to take values in                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}Z{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            Z                      2                                                                    .

While foundational results such as the Kochen-Specker and Gleason theorems are valid in the context of infinite precision, they fail to hold in general in a world with limited resources. Here we employ an interval-valued framework to establish bounds on the validity of those theorems in realistic experimental environments. In this way, not only can we quantify the idea of finite-precision measurement within our theory, but we can also suggest a possible resolution of the Meyer-Mermin debate on the impact of finite-precision measurement on the Kochen-Specker theorem.},

  abstract  = {Fast-moving sports such as tennis require both players and match officials to make rapid accurate perceptual decisions about dynamic events in the visual world. Disagreements arise regularly, leading to disputes about decisions such as line calls. A number of factors must contribute to these disputes, including lapses in concentration, bias and gamesmanship. Fundamental uncertainty or variability in the sensory information supporting decisions must also play a role. Modern technological innovations now provide detailed and accurate physical information that can be compared against the decisions of players and officials. The present paper uses this psychophysical data to assess the significance of perceptual limitations as a contributor to real-world decisions in professional tennis. A detailed analysis is presented of a large body of data on line-call challenges in professional tennis tournaments over the last 2 years. Results reveal that the vast majority of challenges can be explained in a direct highly predictable manner by a simple model of uncertainty in perceptual information processing. Both players and line judges are remarkably accurate at judging ball bounce position, with a positional uncertainty of less than 40 mm. Line judges are more reliable than players. Judgements are more difficult for balls bouncing near base and service lines than those bouncing near side and centre lines. There is no evidence for significant errors in localization due to image motion.},

The simplest proposed theory is defined over arbitrary finite fields and loses the notion of unitaries. This makes such theories unnaturally strong, permitting the search of unstructured databases faster than asymptotically possible in conventional quantum computing. The next most general approach chooses finite fields with no solution to x^2+1=0, and thus permits an elegant complex-like representation of the extended field by adjoining i=sqrt(-1). Quantum theories over these fields retain the notion of unitaries and --- for particular problem sizes --- allow the same algorithms as conventional quantum theory. These theories, however, still support unnaturally strong computations for certain problem sizes, but the possibility of such phenomena decreases as the size of the field increases.},

  abstract    = {Quantum information processing shows advantages in many tasks, including quantum communication and computation, comparing to its classical counterpart. The essence of quantum processing lies on the fundamental difference between classical and quantum states. For a physical system, the coherent superposition on a computational basis is different from the statistical mixture of states in the same basis. Such coherent superposition endows the possibility of generating true random numbers, realizing parallel computing, and other classically impossible tasks such as quantum Bernoulli factory. Considering a system that consists of multiple parts, the coherent superposition that exists nonlocally on different systems is called entanglement. By properly manipulating entanglement, it is possible to realize computation and simulation tasks that are intractable with classical means. Investigating quantumness, coherent superposition, and entanglement can shed light on the original of quantum advantages and lead to the design of new quantum protocols. This thesis mainly focuses on the interplay between quantumness and two information tasks, randomness generation and selftesting quantum information processing. We discuss how quantumness can be used to generate randomness and show that randomness can in turn be used to quantify quantumness. In addition, we introduce the Bernoulli factory problem and present the quantum advantage with only coherence in both theory and experiment. Furthermore, we show a method to witness entanglement that is independent of the realization of the measurement. We also investigate randomness requirements in selftesting tasks and propose a random number generation scheme that is independent of the randomness source.},

  abstract    = {After a general introduction, the thesis is divided into four parts. In the first, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight the effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward manner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin tossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date while using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task. In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a variant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased coins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional security for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for any bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be unconditionally secure for any bias. The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which, prior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a general model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide range of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit cheating attacks for such functions. In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random string, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her devices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an arbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture securely perform this task. The first allows a private random string to be expanded by a finite amount, while the second generates an arbitrarily large expansion of such a string.},

It will help new quantum programmers in an instructive manner. We choose Quipper especially for its usability and scalability though it's an ongoing development project. We have also provided introductory concepts of Quipper and prerequisite backgrounds of the algorithms for readers' convenience. We also have written codes for oracles (black boxes or functions) for individual algorithms and tested some of them using the Quipper simulator to prove correctness and introduce the readers with the functionality. As Quipper 0.5 does not include more than \ensuremath{4 \times 4} matrix constructors for Unitary operators, we have also implemented \ensuremath{8 \times 8} and \ensuremath{16 \times 16} matrix constructors.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing aim of quantum information research is to understand what gives quantum computers their advantage. This requires separating problems that need genuinely quantum resources from those for which classical resources are enough. Two examples of quantum speed-up are the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's problem, both efficiently solvable on a quantum Turing machine, and both believed to lack efficient classical solutions. Here we present a framework that can simulate both quantum algorithms efficiently, solving the Deutsch-Jozsa problem with probability 1 using only one oracle query, and Simon's problem using linearly many oracle queries, just as expected of an ideal quantum computer. The presented simulation framework is in turn efficiently simulatable in a classical probabilistic Turing machine. This shows that the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's problem do not require any genuinely quantum resources, and that the quantum algorithms show no speed-up when compared with their corresponding classical simulation. Finally, this gives insight into what properties are needed in the two algorithms, and calls for further study of oracle separation between quantum and classical computation.},

This perspective suggests that, even in the case of quantum algorithms, the control flow notions of sequencing, conditionals, loops, and recursion are entirely classical. There is however, another notion of control flow, that is itself quantum. The notion of quantum conditional expression is reasonably well-understood: the execution of the two expressions becomes itself a superposition of executions. The quantum counterpart of loops and recursion is however not believed to be meaningful in its most general form.},

  abstract  = {Today's science provides quite a lean picture of time as a mere geometric evolution parameter. I argue that time is much richer. In particular, I argue that besides the geometric time, there is creative time, when objective chance events happen. The existence of the latter follows straight from the existence of free-will. Following the French philosopher Lequyer, I argue that free-will is a prerequisite for the possibility to have rational argumentations, hence can't be denied. Consequently, science can't deny the existence of creative time and thus that time really passes.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is divided into three parts. The first part studies the connection and comparison between the decentralized menu contracting procedure and the centralized mechanism contracting procedure in multi-agency games with ϵ-ex post implementation. We establish the revelation principle and delegation principle for ϵ-ex post implementation. According to these principles, ϵ-ex post menu design is merely strategically equivalent to individual-based ϵ-ex post mechanism design rather than joint-based ϵ-ex post mechanism design. We show that joint-based ϵ-ex post mechanism design always weakly dominates individual-based ϵ-ex post mechanism design and ϵ-ex post menu design. We also provide economically interesting sufficient conditions for when the former strictly dominates the former two and when the former is equivalent to the latter two. The second part investigates the counterpart in generalized multi-agency contracting games with Bayesian implementation. Bayesian menu design is merely strategically equivalent to individual-based Bayesian mechanism design rather than joint-based Bayesian mechanism design. We also provide several sets of economically interesting sufficient conditions for when joint-based BIC mechanism design can still make the principal as well off as individual-based BIC mechanism design and Bayesian menu design. The third part (joint with Frank H. Page, Jr) provides a generalized model concerning the one-shot pure-strategy moral hazard contracting game with the inclusion of observable actions as well as unobservable actions. We present the justification of the inclusion of observable actions as contingencies in contracts in views of the influence of existing observable actions. Primarily, we propose conditions under which the solution to such a principal-agent problem exists. It is valuable for the principal to include observable actions as contingencies in contracts. Including observable actions along with the outcomes in the contract can reinforce the incentive of outcome-contingent contracts and curb the agent's opportunist tendency.},

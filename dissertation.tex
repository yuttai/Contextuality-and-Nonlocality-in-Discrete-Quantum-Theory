\begin{acknowledgments}
The acknowledgments are designed to recognize people or agencies to whom you feel grateful for any academic,
technical, financial, or personal aid in the preparation of your thesis or dissertation; as a matter of
courtesy, you would ordinarily mention the members of your committee here, as well as institutions that
provided funding, your typist, or anyone else who helped.

\begin{abstract}
 The abstract is double-spaced and limited to 350 words. As many people will learn about
your work through your abstract published in Dissertation Abstracts (http://proquest.umi.com/login),
you should spend a good bit of effort in the composition of both the abstract and the title of your work.
Try to convey the flavor of your work, not just the bare bones of your findings; in an average abstract
there will be about 70 characters per line with a maximum of 35 lines. You should also work to phrase your
title so that it truly describes the contents and will be easily found in the index of Dissertation Abstracts.
The index is based on key words, so be as specific as you can be about your subject.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Textbook quantum mechanics asserts that, given a quantum spin system described
 by the wave function 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\psi}=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\fket{\ps\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{\sqrt{4-\pi}}{2}\fket{\minus\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

 and given the observable 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{z}=\frac{\hbar}{2}(\fproj{\ps\frac{1}{2}}-\fproj{\minus\frac{1}{2}})$
\end_inset

, then the probability of observing the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\ps\frac{\hbar}{2}$
\end_inset

 (with post-measurement state 
\begin_inset Formula $\fket{\ps\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

) is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

 and the probability of observing the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\minus\frac{\hbar}{2}$
\end_inset

 (with post-measurement state 
\begin_inset Formula $\fket{\minus\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

) is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

.
 According to the frequency interpretation of probability, the above assertion
 implies that when performing a very large number of experiments on quantum
 systems described by wave function 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\psi}$
\end_inset

, a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

 of the experiments will result in the observation 
\begin_inset Formula $\ps\frac{\hbar}{2}$
\end_inset

 and the remaining fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

 will result in the observation 
\begin_inset Formula $\minus\frac{\hbar}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reality, i.e., in an actual experiment, simulation, or computation, bounded
 by space, time, and energy resources, the situation is much fuzzier: (i)
 we cannot 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 prepare the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\psi}$
\end_inset

; (ii) we cannot build a measurement apparatus corresponding 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 to observable 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{z}$
\end_inset

; and (iii) we cannot prepare 
\emph on
exact
\emph default
 replicas of any state.
 In other words, we can only perform a limited number of experiments on
 quantum systems closely related to wave function 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\psi}$
\end_inset

 and using an apparatus that closely approximates observable 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Given any fixed resources, these experiments will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 result in the 
\emph on
exact
\emph default
 fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

 of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\ps\frac{\hbar}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

 of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\minus\frac{\hbar}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, these experiments can be viewed as a method (algorithm) to calculate
 the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and it is known that the state of the art algorithms for computing the
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 require on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(n\log^{O\left(1\right)}\left(n\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 operations
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In other words, calculating the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th digit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 appears to require more and more physical resources as
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 gets larger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of this is well-known and holds in both the classical and quantum worlds.
 In the classical world, these observations are believed to be well-understood
 approximations to an idealized independent reality that can continuously
 approached with more and more resources.
 The question in the quantum world is more subtle; it is not evident at
 all that this resource-aware perspective does not alter the very foundations
 of quantum mechanics.
 Indeed taking such resource bounds into consideration is what founded computer
 science as a discipline and has become crucial for understanding the very
 nature of computation.
 Following Feynman

, and others, one might argue that this resource-bounded perspective is
 also crucial for understanding the very nature of physical processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In previous work, we analyzed the wave function description of quantum systems
 from a resource-bounded perspective.
 Technically, instead of postulating that quantum states are rays in a Hilbert
 space, i.e., we instead used special finite fields whose size reflected the
 available resources.

 been founded on the infinitely precise real or complex numbers

 Our purpose here is to exploit the consequences of replacing infinitely-specifi
ed quantum probabilities by finite number of intervals used in interval-valued
 probability measures

(IVPM); in particular, we show that a quantum IVPM may not be induced by
 a infinitely-precise state, but it might be more and more likely to be
 identified to a particular state when the measurement resources increase.

Indeed, almost every description of quantum mechanics, quantum computation,
 or quantum experiments refers to entities such as

\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

 From a computational perspective, such numbers do not exist in their entirety

\begin_layout Standard
We have been revisiting quantum mechanics, quantum information, and quantum
 computation from this resource-aware perspective.
 Our initial results in that domain showed how subtle the issues can be

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

: a straightforward replacement of the complex numbers by a finite field
 yields a variant of quantum mechanics in which computationally hard problems
 like UNIQUE-SAT (which decides whether a given Boolean formula is unsatisfiable
 or has exactly one satisfying assignment

) can be deterministically solved in constant time.
 To eliminate such unrealistic theories requires delicate analysis of the
 structure of the Hilbert space, the process of observation, and the notion
 of probability teasing apart their reliance on the infinitely precise real
 numbers

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we shift focus from the infinitely-specified but not directly
 observable quantum states, to observable measurable properties of quantum
 systems and their probabilities.
 Furthermore, we insist that our theories of measurement and probability
 only refer to finitely communicable evidence within feasible computational
 bounds.
 It follows that states, observations, and probabilities all become 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuzzy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e., specified by intervals of confidence that can only increase in precision
 if the available resources increase proportionally.
 Our notion of

 is related to existing work

 but, as will be explained in more detail, is distinguished by its unique
 computational character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will begin by reviewing existing work that recasts classical probability
 spaces in a resource-aware setting and move to aim at recasting quantum
 probability and quantum measurement.
 In particular, we develop a measurement framework based on quantum IVPM.
 Surprisingly, we found a quantum IVPM which can not be induced by a state,
 while Shapley proved a classical convex IVPM can always be induced by a
 classical

state

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and Gleason proved a infinitely-specified quantum probabilities measure
 can always be induced by a quantum state

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum"

\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, a quantum IVPM could still correspond to many possible states
 if it is broken into pieces.
 Our examples also suggest that a quantum IVPM could be more and more likely
 induced by a state while the intervals become sharper, i.e., the measurement
 resources increase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Gleason's theorem supports the idea of von Neumann to define a state
 as a density matrix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Varadarajan2008"

\end_inset

, a density matrix might not be a adequate imprecise quantum state.
 Instead, a imprecise quantum state might be more like an interactive system
 suggested by Quantum Bayesianism or QBism

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which would interact differently with different clients.
 Furthermore, the validity the fundamental theorems of quantum mechanics
 followed up by Gleason's theorem, such as Bell

 Our research then might provide a new insight to the old debate among Meyer,
 Mermin, and others about whether finite precision measurement would nullify
 the Kochen-Specker theorem or not

The conventional definition of a probability space builds upon the field
 of real numbers.
 In more detail, a probability space consists of a

\end_inset

\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $\pmeas$

 mapping events in 
\begin_inset Formula $\events$
\end_inset

 to the real interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 We will only consider 
\emph on
finite

 sets of events and restrict our attention to non-empty finite sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 as the sample space.
 The space of events

 includes every possible subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

\begin_inset Formula $2^{\Omega}=\set{E}{E\subseteq\Omega}$

.
 For future reference, we emphasize that events are the primary notion of
 interest and that the sample space is a convenient artifact that allows
 us to treat events as sets obeying the laws of Boolean algebra

 Consider an experiment that tosses two coins.
 We have four possible outcomes that constitute the sample space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$

 There are 16 total events including the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\{HH,HT\}$
\end_inset

 that the first coin lands heads up, the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\{HT,TH\}$
\end_inset

 that the two coins land on opposite sides, and the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\{HT,TH,TT\}$
\end_inset

 that at least one coin lands tails up.
 Here is a possible probability measure for these events: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 Such numbers cannot be computed.
 This interval also includes numbers like 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi/4$
\end_inset

 which can only be computed with increasingly large resources as the precision
 increases.
 Therefore, in a resource-aware computational or experimental setting, it
 is more appropriate to consider probability measures that map events to
 a set of elements computable with a fixed set of resources.

\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 It is a known fact that the probability of the needle crossing a line is

 Consider an experimental setup consisting of a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 identical needles of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

.
 We throw the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 needles one needle at a time, and observe the number 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}$
\end_inset

 of needles that cross a line, thus estimating the probability of a needle
 crossing a line to be 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}/M$
\end_inset

.
 In an actual experiment with 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset

 needles and the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell/h=0.75$

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, it was found that 
\begin_inset Formula $236$
\end_inset

 crossed a line so the relative frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.472$
\end_inset

 whereas the idealized mathematical probability is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.4774\ldots$
\end_inset

.
 In a larger experiment with 
\begin_inset Formula $5000$
\end_inset

 needles and the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell/h=0.8$

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $0.5064$
\end_inset

 whereas the idealized mathematical probability is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5092\ldots$
\end_inset

 We see that the observed probability approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $2\ell/\left(\pi h\right)$
\end_inset

 but only if 
\emph on
larger and larger resources
\emph default
 are expended.
 These resource considerations suggest that it is possible to replace the
 real interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 with rational numbers up to a certain precision related to the particular
 experiment in question.
 There is clearly a connection between the number of needles and the achievable
 precision: in the hypothetical experiment with 3 needles, it is not sensible
 to retain 100 digits in the expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\ell/\left(\pi h\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another more subtle assumption of unbounded computational power
 in the experiment.
 We are assuming that we can always determine with certainty whether a needle
 is crossing a line.
 But 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the the floor have thickness, their distance apart is not exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, and the needles' lengths are not all absolutely equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

.
 These perturbations make the events 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuzzy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thus, in an experiment with limited resources, it is not possible to talk
 about the idealized event that exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}$
\end_inset

 needles cross lines as this would require the most expensive needles built
 to the most precise accuracy, laser precision for drawing lines on the
 floor, and the most powerful microscopes to determine if a needle does
 cross a line.
 Instead we might talk about the event that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}-\delta$
\end_inset

 needles evidently cross lines and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}+\delta'$
\end_inset

 needles plausibly cross lines where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta'$
\end_inset

 are resource-dependent approximations.
 This fuzzy notion of events leads to probabilities being only calculable
 within intervals of confidence reflecting the certainty of events and their
 plausibility.
 This is indeed consistent with published experiments: in an experiment
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $3204$
\end_inset

 needles and the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell/h=0.6$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1213$
\end_inset

 needles clearly crossed a line and 
\begin_inset Formula $11$
\end_inset

 needles were close enough to plausibly be considered as crossing the line:
 we would express the probability in this case as the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\frac{1213}{3204},\frac{1224}{3204}\right]$
\end_inset

 expressing that we are certain that the event has probability at least
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1213}{3204}$
\end_inset

 but it is possible that it would have probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1224}{3204}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to re-express the above observations is that the calculus of
 probabilities requires all probabilities to be 
\emph on
coherent
\emph default
 (e.g., the probability of the union of two disjoint events is the sum of
 their probabilities).
 But given limited resources, the calculation of a probability measure can
 only be approximate and hence the probabilities cannot be absolutely guaranteed
 to be coherent in the ideal sense.

 may have an interval of probability 
\begin_inset Formula $[l_{1},r_{1}]$

 Assume that another disjoint event 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 has an interval of probability 
\begin_inset Formula $[l_{2},r_{2}]$
\end_inset

, what is the interval of probability for the event 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}\cup E_{2}$
\end_inset

? The answer is somewhat subtle: although it is possible to use the sum
 of the intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $[l_{1}+l_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]$
\end_inset

 as the combined probability, one can find a much tighter interval if informatio
n 
\emph on

\emph default
 the event (i.e., information about the complement event) is also taken into
 consideration.
 Formally, for a general event 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $[l,r]$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $E$

 is evidence supporting the complement of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 The complement of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 must therefore have probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1-r,1-l\right]$

If we were to equate 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\Omega)$
\end_inset

 with the sum of the individual probabilities, we would get that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\Omega)=\left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 However, using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\emptyset)=\imposs$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}\left(\Omega\right)=1-\bar{\mu}\left(\emptyset\right)=\necess=[1,1]$
\end_inset

.
 This interval is tighter and a better estimate for the probability of the
 event 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, and of course it is contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}]$
\end_inset

.
 However it is only possible to exploit the information about the complement
 when all four events are combined.
 Thus the 
\begin_inset Formula $\subseteq$
\end_inset

-condition allows us to get an estimate for the combined event from each
 of its constituents and then gather more evidence knowing the aggregate
 event.

The mathematical framework of classical probability above assumes that there
 exists a predetermined set of events that are independent of the particular
 experiment — classical physics is non-contextual

.
 However, even in classical situations, the structure of the event space
 is often only partially known and the precise dependence of two events
 on each other cannot, a priori, be determined with certainty.
 In the quantum framework, this partial knowledge is compounded by the fact
 that there exist non-commuting events which cannot happen simultaneously.
 To accommodate these more complex situations, conventional approaches to
 quantum probability abandon the sample space
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 and reason directly about events which are generalized from plain sets
 to projection operators.
 A quantum probability space therefore consists of just two components:
 a set of events 
\begin_inset Formula $\qevents$
\end_inset

 often formalized as projection operators and a probability measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\qevents\rightarrow[0,1]$

 For example, the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{0}$

 indicates that the post-measurement state will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0}$
\end_inset

; the probability of such an event depends on the current state; the event

\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1}$

 states that the post-measurement state will be the empty state and is impossibl

 As in the classical case, a probability measure is a function that maps
 events to 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 Here is a partial specification of a possible probability measure that
 would be induced by a system whose current state is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\mathbb{0}\right)=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\mathbb{1}\right)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\proj{0}\right)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\proj{1}\right)=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\proj{\ps}\right)=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, \SpecialChar ldots
.
 Note that, similarly to the classical case, the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{1}$
\end_inset

 is 1 and the probability of collections of orthogonal events (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{0}+\proj{1}$
\end_inset

) is the sum of the individual probabilities.
 A collection of non-orthogonal events (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{\ps}$
\end_inset

) is however not even a valid event.
 In the classical example, we argued that each probability measure is uniquely
 determined by two actual coins.
 A similar (but much more subtle) argument is valid also in the quantum
 case.
 By postulates of quantum mechanics and Gleason's theorem, it turns out
 that for large enough quantum systems, each probability measure is uniquely
 determined by an actual quantum state as discussed next.

Measuring Quantum Probabilities

 For instance, if one wants to determine the probability that the spin of
 a given silver atom is 
\begin_inset Formula $+\hbar/2$
\end_inset

, a Stern-Gerlach apparatus is built where ideally an inhomogeneous magnetic
 field is generated along, let's say, the quantization axis 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 One then produces a collimated beam of identically prepared (neutral) silver
 atoms that is directed between the poles of the magnet where a predetermined
 field-gradient along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 direction has been established.
 Under appropriate experimental conditions we will observe that the beam,
 after traversing the magnetic-field region, will be deflected towards two
 regions identified by distinguished spots on a detector situated behind
 the apparatus

 Each of the two discrete values is associated to either 
\begin_inset Formula $+\hbar/2$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hbar/2$
\end_inset

, commonly called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spin up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spin down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, respectively.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

counting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the number of atoms that are deflected in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spin up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 region one can, in principle, estimate the probability that the prepared
 state of the silver atom state has spin 
\begin_inset Formula $+\hbar/2$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that a real experiment does not necessarily represent an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ideal measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For example, not all silver atoms will be identically prepared, or the
 field-gradient could not be large enough to distinguish between the spin
 up and down situations simply producing a large single blot.
 In other words, the closer we get to an ideal measurement the better we
 determine those probabilities at the cost of significantly increasing the
 number of resources.
 It is not very well appreciated in the literature that Bohr attempted to
 argue against the measurability of the spin of a free electron

 an elegant use of uncertainty relations

) that a Stern-Gerlach experiment could not succeed in establishing the
 spin of an unbound electron because the Lorentz force would blur the detected
 pattern.
 This example illustrates the case of a fundamental physical limitation
 that not even infinite resources could mitigate.

 we believe an event will happen or not, the classical world could be modeled
 in a simpler way.
 If the complete initial conditions for tossing a coin or throwing a needle
 is known, we can determine whether an event will happen or not for sure

Although sharing a lot of similarity, the Kochen-Specker theorem highlight
 the difference between quantum and classical measures.
 When we think a cryptodeterministic measure as a model of pasted events,
 the Kochen-Specker theorem also consistent with the usual interpretation
 of the quantum theory: we should not ask whether an event happened or not
 if an event is incompatible with the event really happened; events compatible
 with the event really happened are the only askable events.

\noindent
Formally, we can ask: what can we deduce about the state of a quantum system
 given a quantum interval-valued probability measure, i.e., given observations
 done with finite resources.
 In the case that the intervals are infinitely precise, the question reduces
 to Gleason's theorem which states that the state of the quantum system
 is uniquely determined by the probability measure.
 But surely the less resources are available, the less precise the intervals,
 and the less we expect to know about the state of the system.
 To formally state and answer this question we begin with defining the 
\emph on
core

\noindent
The core of an interval-valued probability measure is the set of real-valued
 infinitely-precise probability measures it approximates.
 An interval-valued probability measure is convex if whenever certain intervals
 exist then combinations of these intervals must also exist, guaranteeing
 we can add and manipulate probabilities coherently.
 In the classical world, every convex measure has a non-empty core, which
 means that the interval-valued probability measure must approximate at
 least one infinitely-precise measure.

 limited resources and poor precision may not uniquely identify the true
 state of the system, there is always at least one system that is consistent

\begin_layout Section
Why Empty Core?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The possibility that a convex quantum interval-valued probability measure
 has an empty core departs from the classical case.
 To understand the meaning of it, we will first study how to recover the
 non-empty core with extra conditions.
 We will then consider having an empty core as an legitimate result, and
 understand its consequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Convexity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possibility for having an empty core is that the definition of quantum
 convexity is too weak.
 On one hand, strengthening equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Convex"

\end_inset

) to non-commuting projectors
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $P_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

 is unlikely to succeed because the product of non-commuting projectors
 is not a projector.
 On the other hand, strengthening equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Convex"

\end_inset

) among commuting projectors cannot guarantee a non-empty core as well if
 we follow what people strengthen convexity classically.
 Equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Convex"

\end_inset

) classically is a special case of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}'\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{N}E_{i}\right)+\sum_{{{\scriptstyle I\subseteq\left\{ 1,\ldots,N\right\} }\atop {\scriptstyle \left|I\right|\textrm{ is odd}}}}\bar{\mu}'\left(\bigcap_{i\in I}E_{i}\right)\subseteq\sum_{{{\scriptstyle I\subseteq\left\{ 1,\ldots,N\right\} }\atop {\scriptstyle \left|I\right|\textrm{ is even}}}}\bar{\mu}'\left(\bigcap_{i\in I}E_{i}\right)\label{eq:Dempster-Shafer-game}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

when 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}'$
\end_inset

 is a classical interval-valued probability measure.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}'$
\end_inset

 satisfies equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Dempster-Shafer-game"

\end_inset

) for all set of event
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ E_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}\subseteq2^{\Omega}$
\end_inset

, then the left-end point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}'$
\end_inset

 is called a Dempster-Shafer belief function.
 It is reasonable to call a quantum interval-valued probability
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 Dempster-Shafer if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}\left(\bigvee_{i=1}^{N}P_{i}\right)+\sum_{{{\scriptstyle I\subseteq\left\{ 1,\ldots,N\right\} }\atop {\scriptstyle \left|I\right|\textrm{ is odd}}}}\bar{\mu}\left(\prod_{i\in I}P_{i}\right)\subseteq\sum_{{{\scriptstyle I\subseteq\left\{ 1,\ldots,N\right\} }\atop {\scriptstyle \left|I\right|\textrm{ is even}}}}\bar{\mu}\left(\prod_{i\in I}P_{i}\right)\textrm{ .}\label{eq:Dempster-Shafer-game-quantum}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

for all set of mutually orthogonal projections
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}\subseteq\events$
\end_inset

.
 However, the quantum interval-valued probability measure in example
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ex:three-dimensional-three-value"

\end_inset

 is Dempster-Shafer and has an empty core.
 In summary, it is unlikely to guarantee a non-empty core by strengthening
 convexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Commuting Sub-Event Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason for having an empty core is the existence of non-commuting
 observables.
 Non-commutativity is one of the difference between quantum and classical
 since Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states there is an intrinsic uncertain
ty measuring non-commuting observables in quantum mechanics
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heisenberg1983,peres1995quantum,544199,Griffiths2003,Jaeger2007"

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, we argue that the quantum phenomenon disappears when we restrict
 the domain of a quantum interval-valued probability measure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$
\end_inset

 on a mutually commuting subspace
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\events'$
\end_inset

.
 As proved in theorem
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thm:sub-event-space"

\end_inset

, the restricted 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}|_{\events'}$
\end_inset

 is essentially a classical interval-valued probability measure.
 Furthermore, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is convex, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}|_{\events'}$
\end_inset

 will be convex, and have a non-empty core classically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is restricted to different commuting 
\begin_inset Formula $\events'$
\end_inset

, the core elements of each 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}|_{\events'}$
\end_inset

 may not be glued together, and gives a core element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 The inability of gluing core elements among commuting 
\begin_inset Formula $\events'$
\end_inset

 to non-commuting 
\begin_inset Formula $\events$
\end_inset

 is consistent with the proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem, where each
 triple of commuting observables could be colored well, but we cannot color
 all observables which are not all commuting.
 This is also consistent with the assertion that mutually commuting observables
 could be measured simultaneously
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mermin_1993"

\end_inset

.
 In another word, if Alice and Bob in Bell's theorem can only pick from
 a set of mutually commuting observables, they could never observe any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum,
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 and prove the quantum theory cannot be simulated by a local hidden variable
 theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Increase the Measurement Resource
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section extend the idea of restricting the event space, but instead
 of commuting sub-event space, we will try to find some subset
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\events'\subseteq\events$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}|_{\events'}$
\end_inset

 has an non-empty core.
 This could help us understand the core because of the following identity
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}\right)=\bigcap_{\events'\subseteq\events}\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events'}\right)\label{eq:core-intersection}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

if we know more about the right-hand side of the equation, we can have more
 idea about the left-hand side.
 This idea can be applied to example
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\events_{1}=\events\backslash\left\{ \proj{\ps'}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\imposs$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events_{1}}\right)=\left\{ \mu_{\ket{2}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}\right\} $
\end_inset

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events_{2}}\right)=\left\{ \mu_{\ket{1}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}\right\} $
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Itemize
When 
\begin_inset Formula $\events_{3}=\events\backslash\left\{ \proj{0},\proj{\ps},\proj{\ps'}\right\} $
\end_inset

, because 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\proj{\phi})\ne\necess$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\phi}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\frac{\mathbb{1}}{3}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}\in\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events_{3}}\right)$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\ket{2}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\ket{1}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}\in\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events_{3}}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these possibilities is compatible with some but not all of the observati
ons.
 In another word, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}\right)=\bigcap_{\events'\subseteq\events}\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events'}\right)\subseteq\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events_{1}}\right)\cap\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events_{2}}\right)=\left\{ \mu_{\ket{2}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}\right\} \cap\left\{ \mu_{\ket{1}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}\right\} =\emptyset\textrm{ .}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The first two possibilities are particular interesting since each two 1-dimensio

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $\events'\subseteq\events$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}|_{\events'}\right)=\left\{ \mu_{\ket{\psi_{0}}\times\ket{\psi_{1}}}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{B}}}\right\} $

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 has a non-empty core, the states mapping to 
\begin_inset Formula $\imposs$
\end_inset

 is contained in a plane, which contains no area in the sphere.
 On the other hand, if the states mapping to

 Therefore, the area of the 1-dimensional projectors mapping to 
\begin_inset Formula $\imposs$

In this sense, we found that the area of the 1-dimensional projectors mapping
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\imposs$
\end_inset

 depends on the maximal length of the intervals, which represents the ability
 of measurement equipment.
 In particular, we have the following results whose details are described

In general, we conjecture that if the measurement equipment is made more
 and more precise, the corresponding interval-valued probability measure
 will be closer and closer to the Born rule.
 In the limit case,

 we do indeed recover the conventional Gleason's theorem and the Born rule.

Wigner's Friends
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation of empty core might not be that strange if we think in terms
 of Wigner's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

friends.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In the original story of Wigner and his friend
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wigner1961,FuchsMerminSchack2014"

\end_inset

, the friend makes a measurement in a closed laboratory and experiences
 an outcome.
 Wigner, outside the laboratory, doesn't experience an outcome.
 If he believes what his friend has told him about her plans in her laboratory
 he will assign an entangled state to her, her apparatus, and the system
 on which she is making her intervention.
 If Wigner goes on to ask his friend about her experience, then the entangled
 state to her, her apparatus, and the system will change into one in which
 they even have separate wave functions, and Wigner and his friend will
 use the same wave function to describe the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question is what happens if Wigner has more than one friend in the laborator
y.
 Suppose Wigner has three friends: E, P, and R in the laboratory.
 E, P, and R measure the spin-1 system described in example
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ex:three-dimensional-three-value"

\end_inset

.
 After the experiment, E tells Wigner 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{0}$
\end_inset

 never happened, P tells Wigner 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{\ps}$
\end_inset

 never happened, and R tells Wigner 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{\ps'}$
\end_inset

 never happened.
 Wigner may then need to use the quantum Dempster-Shafer rule(?) or other
 rules(?) to combine the belief told by his friends, and the combined belief
 might be the quantum interval-valued probability measure in example

Conclusion and Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we insist that probabilities cannot be computed to infinite precision
 and are bound to be approximations represented by intervals of confidence,
 then quantum states themselves can only be discussed within intervals of
 confidence.
 Despite the fact that classically a IVPM could always correspond to a real-valu
ed probability measure, we found that there may be no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 infinitely-precise quantum state approximated by a quantum IVPM as a whole.
 However, if a quantum IVPM is decomposed into pieces, each piece might
 still be induced by a quantum state.
 Moreover, our examples and Gleason's theorem summarized in table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table_long"

\end_inset

 suggests that as the measurement resources increase, an entire quantum
 IVPM could more and more likely be identified to a particular state.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we discussed how a quantum IVPM could be induced from a real quantum
 state, our investigation leaves an open question of whether there exists
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 entity that exists independently of measurements and probabilities.
 The possibility of no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 underlying state is consistent with the elegantly recent work on Quantum
 Bayesianism or QBism

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, which suggests that the quantum state is more like an interactive system
 in computer science parlance.
 In another word, the quantum state is subjective: each observer has a different
 view of the quantum system that is consistent with their previous observations
 and that allows that observer, independently of other observers, to assign
 beliefs (i.e., probabilities) to possible future interactions.

 gives a real interval-valued frame function, if we prove there is no real
 interval-valued frame function satisfying a condition, then there must
 be no complex interval-valued frame function satisfying the corresponding
 condition.
 From now on, when we write an interval-valued frame function
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 without other specification, we would always means a real interval-valued
 frame function
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}:S^{2}\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 has a non-empty core, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 must be in the case 1 - 3 in the end of appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Interval-valued-Frame-Functions"

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)$
\end_inset

 contains no area in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)$
\end_inset

 contains some area in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

, it must be the situation of case 4, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 has an empty core.
 Furthermore, the larger the area, the more state vectors which are inconsistent
 with any particular Born rule frame function.
 Therefore, the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)$
\end_inset

 could indicate how much 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 deviate from the Born rule frame functions.
 In the following paragraphs, we will establish that if the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)$
\end_inset

 is big, then the interval
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{I}$
\end_inset

 must be coarse.
 In another word, if the interval
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{I}$
\end_inset

 is finer, then the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)$
\end_inset

 would be smaller so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 is closer to a Born rule frame function.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to simplify the discussion, consider the center of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)$
\end_inset

 as the north pole, and assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 maps every state whose latitude is larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 to impossible.

Between Quantum and Classical

\begin_layout Standard
This section discusses the relation between quantum and classical.
 We first prove that any quantum phenomenon would not be observed if we
 could only access commuting projectors since commuting projectors could
 be measured simultaneously

 Based on this fact, we show a quantum IVPM
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is convex if its restriction on any orthonormal basis

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}^{\Omega}$
\end_inset

, is a convex classical IVPM.
 Together with the fact that every classical IVPM
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}^{\Omega}$
\end_inset

 is convex when the number of elements in

, every quantum IVPM must be convex on a three-dimensional Hilbert space.

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\left\{ \ket{j}\right\} _{j=0}^{d-1}$

 In particular, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is convex, each 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}|_{\events^{\Omega}}$
\end_inset

 is convex and has a non-empty core.
 However, the core elements of each

 The inability of gluing core elements among commuting

 to non-commuting 
\begin_inset Formula $\events$

 is consistent with the idea of the Kochen-Specker theorem, that each triple
 of commuting observables could be colored well, but we cannot color all
 observables which are not all commuting.
 This is also consistent with the assertion that mutually commuting observables
 could be measured simultaneously

Expectation Values for IVPMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may need to understand how to define expectation values of an observable
 for quantum IVPMs.
 Recall an observable is the quantum version of a random variable.
 Hence, in order to define expectation values of an observable, we need
 to understand the definition of expectation values of a random variable
 for an classical IVPM.
 Since the expectation value of random variable
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int X\rmd\pmeas$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kolmogorov1950"

\end_inset

, we need to understand the meaning of integration on IVPMs.
 In the rest of the section, we will consider the real-valued and interval-value
d probability measure defined in example
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ex1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ex3"

\end_inset

, and see how to compute the expectation value of different random variables.
 To simplify the discussion later, we will only consider a random variable
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 which is a step function, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\mathbf{1}_{E_{i}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}\in\events$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{1}_{E}$

Given a random variable
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and a probability measure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\pmeas$
\end_inset

, the expectation value of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\int X\rmd\pmeas & = & \sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\pmeas\left(E_{i}\right)\textrm{ .}\label{eq:expectation}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Intuitively, the expectation value is weighted average of the possible outcomes
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 with the weight equal to the probability of each outcome could happen.
 For example, consider the random variable
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $X_{0}$
\end_inset

 representing the number of tails.

Intuitively, the expectation value of an observable with respect to an IVPM
 should be the minimum and maximum expectation value of the same observable
 with respect to its consistent states.
 We found this is true when we require our IVPM to be convex, and on a commuting
 sub-event space, whose definition is given as follow.

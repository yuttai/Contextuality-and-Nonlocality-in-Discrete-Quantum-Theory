\begin{abstract}

We present a mathematical framework based on quantum interval-valued
probability measures to study the effect of experimental imperfections
and finite precision measurements on defining aspects of quantum
mechanics such as contextuality and the Born rule. While foundational
results such as the Kochen-Specker and Gleason theorems fail to hold
in general in a world with limited resources, when we allow infinite
precision, their validity is recovered.  However, we are able to use
the interval-valued framework to establish bounds on the validity of
those theorems in realistic experimental environments. In this way,
not only can we quantify the idea of finite-precision measurement
within our theory, but we can also suggest a possible resolution of
the Meyer-Mermin debate on the impact of finite-precision measurement
on the Kochen-Specker theorem.

\section{Introduction}

There are long-standing debates in the foundations of quantum
mechanics regarding the tension between finite precision measurement
and contextuality\nb\cite{BarrettKent2004,Appleby_2005}, which refers to the fact that the results of measuring compatible sets of observables depend  on whether they are measured together or separately.  For example,
Meyer\nb\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751} and Mermin\nb\cite{Mermin1999} disagree
on whether finite-precision measurements invalidate the spirit of the Kochen-Specker
theorem\nb\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum}, which is a mathematical statement about contextuality.   The Kochen-Specker theorem asserts that, in a Hilbert space of dimension
$d \ge 3$, it is impossible to associate definite measured values, $\mu(P_i)= 0$
or $1$, with every projection operator\nb$P_i$, in such a way that, if a set of commuting $P_i$ satisfies $\sum_i P_i = 1$, then $\sum_i \mu(P_i) = 1$. In contrast, Meyer showed that 
one {\it can\/}  assign definite values $0$ or $1$ to the measurement outcome $\mu(P_i)$ when the Hilbert space is defined over the field of rational numbers, therefore nullifying the theorem\nb\citep{PhysRevLett.83.3751}.
However, Mermin then argued that measurement outcomes must depend smoothly
on slight changes in the experimental configuration. Mermin therefore claimed that 
the impact of Meyer's negative result  is ``unsupportable''\nb\citep{Mermin1999}. 
Discussion
has continued on whether contextuality is consistent with  experimental outcomes\nb\cite{Spekkens2005,GuehneKleinmannCabelloEtAl2010,MazurekPuseyKunjwalEtAl2016}.
A fundamental question is how to address this controversy by developing
 mathematical theories of quantum mechanics that are intrinsically, rather than only implicitly, consistent with the resources available for the realistic accuracy of an actual measurement.

In this paper, we extend our previous work on the foundations of
computability in quantum physics by exploring the application of
interval-valued probability measures (IVPM) to achieving a coherent
formulation of finite-resource quantum mechanics.  To this end, we develop a mathematical framework that includes the uncertainties of finite precision and imperfections in the quantum measurement process. In particular, we quantify the concept of imperfect quantum measurement and its impact on the interpretation of the Kochen-Specker and Gleason theorems and their implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics.  Our first observation is that essential objectives of our program to
achieve a computable theory of quantum mechanics and finite-resource
measurement, attempted previously with computable number
systems\nb\cite{usat,geometry2013apsrev4,DQT2014}, may be achievable by
extending classical interval-valued probability
measures\nb\cite{JamisonLodwick2004} to the quantum domain.  We thus begin by axiomatizing a quantum interval-valued probability measure (QIVPM) framework.

The effect of finite precision and imperfections on contextuality and the
Kochen-Specker theorem is shown to have a resolution in terms of our QIVPM framework.  
To proceed, we use a formulation of the ``Mermin-Peres square'' \nb\cite{peres1995quantum,Mermin1990Simple} that uses the
expectation value of a physical observable with respect
to a QIVPM, where the interval-valued
expectation value is consistent with the expectation value of the
same observable in conventional quantum mechanics with infinite resources. We show that, 
as long as errors and uncertainties remain smaller than a particular value, the
Kochen-Specker theorem remains valid. In other words, we established a rigorous bound for 
its validity and, therefore, the limits for physical reality to remain contextual.

A key aspect of a quantum measurement is its statistical nature, as reflected
by application of the Born rule to determine the probability of a given measurement 
outcome \nb\citep{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199}. The Gleason
theorem establishes that there is no alternative to the Born rule by 
demonstrating, using reasonable continuity arguments in Hilbert spaces
of dimension $d\ge3$, the existence of a unique state 
$\rho$ consistent with the statistical predictions computed from 
that rule \nb\citep{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum}.
It is then legitimate to question what happens when infinite precision
cannot be achieved. We will show that, if the effect of finite precision is incorporated, 
while a QIVPM  might not be consistent
with a unique state\nb$\rho$ on all projectors defined on a Hilbert space of dimension $d\ge3$, 
there is a mathematically precise sense in which one recovers the original Gleason theorem asymptotically. 
Specifically, if for bounded resources the QIVPM is induced by some mixed states \nb$\rho'$, 
those states will converge to a unique state $\rho$ when the size of the intervals characterizing 
the uncertainties tends to zero. 

The paper is organized as follows.   In Sec.\ \ref{sec:fuzzy} we begin by introducing the foundations of quantum probability space and fuzzy measurement.  We then move on to introduce the concept of quantum interval valued probability in Sec.\ \ref{sec:Interval-Uncertainty}.  This QIVPM will provide the mathematical framework to quantify the impact of finite precision measurements on quantum mechanics.  For instance, in Sec.\ \ref{sec:Kochen-Specker},  we quantify the domain of validity of a  contextual measurement, thus addressing the conditions under which the Kochen-Specker theorem applies.  This provides a way of resolving the Meyer-Mermin debate, which is the main result of our Theorem \ref{cor:Kochen-Specker-IVPM}.  In Sec.\ \ref{sec:Gleason}, we study Gleason's theorem in the context of imprecise measurements, concluding that QIVPM provides a framework with quantitative bounds in which Gleason's theorem, while formally invalid in a universe with bounded resources, holds asymptotically in a mathematically precise way.  Finally, we present our conclusions in Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusion}.

% Textbook quantum mechanics asserts that the probability of a
% measurement can be computed from wave function of the system and the
% measuring observable \emph{exactly} while real measurements must be
% finite precision.  Whether finite precision measurement in reality
% affect the idealized quantum concept, e.g.,
% contextuality\nb\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Mermin1999,BarrettKent2004},
% and the very foundation of quantum mechanics is still a problem. In
% this letter, we model the finite precision quantum measurement by
% quantum interval-valued probability measures (IVPMs) which provides
% not only a uniform framework to understand Gleason's
% theorem\nb\cite{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum} and the
% Kochen-Specker
% theorem\nb\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum,Redhead1987-REDINA,Griffiths2003}
% but also some examples which cannot be explained by the Born
% rule\nb\cite{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}.

% The tension between finite precision measurement and the foundation of
% quantum mechanics sharpened, when the original definition of
% contextuality based on infinitely precise numbers is proved not
% experimental verifiable\nb\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Kent1999}.  After a
% long debate\nb\cite{Mermin1999,Peres2003,BarrettKent2004}, people are
% still trying to update the definition of contextuality when they want
% to perform further
% experiments\nb\cite{Spekkens2005,GuehneKleinmannCabelloEtAl2010,MazurekPuseyKunjwalEtAl2016}.

% We found that finite precision measurement affects not only
% contextuality but also the fundamental rule computing probability from
% a state.  In the early formulation of quantum mechanics, von Neumann
% essentially formulated a quantum state as a density matrix while
% Mackey formulated a quantum state as a quantum probability measure
% which are proved by Gleason to be the essentially same as a density
% matrix\nb\cite{Varadarajan2008}.  Combining quantum probability measures
% and the classical IVPM\nb\cite{JamisonLodwick2004} which could be used
% to formulate classical finite precision measurement, we can define
% quantum IVPMs. Surprisingly, there is a quantum IVPM which cannot be
% compatible with any density matrix according to the Born rule. Similar
% to revising the definition of contextuality because of finite
% precision measurement, the very basic definition of a quantum state or
% how to compute the probability from a state might need to be refined
% when we consider the finite precision measurement. This can also
% provide a new quantum phenomena different from the classical world,
% because IVPMs become classical so that the non-Born IVPMs disappears
% when we restricting the domain of quantum IVPMs on a commuting
% sub-event space.

\section{Fuzzy Measurements}
 \label{sec:fuzzy}
A \emph{probability space} is a mathematical abstraction specifying
the necessary conditions for reasoning coherently about collections of
uncertain events\nb\cite{Kolmogorov1950,544199,Griffiths2003,Grabisch2016}. In the quantum case, the
events of interest are specified by \emph{projection operators}
$P$. These include the empty projection\nb$\mathbb{0}$, the identity
projection\nb$\mathbb{1}$, projections of the form $\proj{\psi}$ where
$\ket{\psi}$ is a pure quantum state (an element of a Hilbert space),
sums of \emph{orthogonal} projections $P_0$ and $P_1$ with
$P_0P_1=\mathbb{0}$, and products of \emph{commuting} projections
$P_0$ and $P_1$ with $P_0P_1=P_1P_0$. In a well-defined quantum
probability
space\nb\cite{10.2307/2308516,gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,Maassen2010},
each event $P_{i}$ is mapped to a probability\nb$\mu(P_{i})$ using
a probability measure\nb$\mu:\events\rightarrow[0,1]$, where $\events$
is the set of all projections on a given Hilbert space, subject to
the following constraints: $\mu(\mathbb{0})=0$, $\mu(\mathbb{1})=1$,
$\mu\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=1-\mu\left(P\right)$, and for each pair
of \emph{orthogonal} projections $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$:
\begin{equation}
{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)={\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\,.\label{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}
\end{equation}

As an example, consider a three-dimensional Hilbert space with
orthonormal basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\}$ and an observable
$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral decomposition
$\proj{0} + 2\,\proj{1} + 3\,\proj{2}$. Two fragments of valid
probability measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ that can associated with this
space are: $\mu_1(\proj{0}) = 0.5$, $\mu_1(\proj{1}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_1(\proj{2}) = 0$, and $\mu_2(\proj{0}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_2(\proj{1}) = 0$, $\mu_2(\proj{2}) = 0.5$. By the Born rule, the
first probability measure corresponds to the quantum system being in a
state $(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}$ and the second corresponds to
the quantum system being in the state
$(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{2})/\sqrt{2}$, where in both cases
$|\alpha|=1$. The expectation value of the observable in the first
case is 1.5 and in the second it is 2.

The above axioms describe a mathematical idealization involving
infinitely precise measurements. In an actual experimental setup with
an ensemble of quantum states that are not exactly identical, and with
small imperfections and inaccuracies in measuring devices, an
experimenter might only be able to determine that the probability of
the event $\proj{0}$ is in the range $[0.49,0.51]$ instead of
precisely 0.5. The spread in this range depends on the amount of
resources (time, energy, money, etc.) that are devoted to the
experiment. In the classical setting, this ``fuzziness'' can be formalized
by moving to \emph{interval-valued probability measures}, which we explore in
the next section, along with our proposed extension to the quantum domain.

% In conventional quantum theory (CQT), when we measure a property
% $\mathbf{O}$ of a physical system whose state is represented by a
% density matrix\nb$\rho$, the probability to obtain the value $\lambda$
% of that property is determined by the Born rule
% $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P_{i}\right)=\Tr\left(\rho
%   P_{i}\right)$, where $P_{i}$ denotes the projector onto the
% eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_{i}$ of the
% Hermitian operator
% $\mathbf{O}$\nb\cite{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}.
% Alternatively, one may say that the state $\rho$ determines the
% probability measure $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ defined as a function
% from the set $\events$ of all possible projectors $P$ onto the
% interval $[0,1]$, and satisfies the following probability axioms\nb
% \cite{10.2307/2308516,gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,Maassen2010}:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\mathbb{0})=0$. 
% \item $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\mathbb{1})=1$. 
% \item $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=
% 1-\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)$. 
% \item For a set of mutually orthogonal projectors $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$,
% $P_iP_j=\delta_{ij}P_i$,
% we have 
% \begin{equation}
% \mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i}\right)=
% \sum_{i=1}^{N}\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P_{i}\right)
% \,.\label{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}
% \end{equation}
% \end{itemize}
% Conversely, given any quantum probability measure\nb$\mu:\events\rightarrow[0,1]$
% satisfying the above axioms, Gleason's theorem asserts that there
% exists a unique state\nb$\rho$ such that $\mu=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$
% in a Hilbert space of dimension $d\geq3$\nb\cite{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum}.

% Furthermore, if we express an observable\nb$\mathbf{O}$ as its spectrum
% decomposition\nb$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}P_{i}$, the expectation
% value of $\mathbf{O}$ is given by\nb\cite{peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}
% \begin{equation}
% \expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho}=\Tr\left(\rho\mathbf{O}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P_{i}\right)\ .\label{eq:quantum-expectation}
% \end{equation}

% To formalize the idea of finite precision measurement, we next
% introduce the notion of quantum interval-valued probability measures
% (\emph{IVPMs})\nb$\bar{\mu}$. The latter replaces the infinitely precise
% interval $[0,1]$ by a finite collection $\mathscr{I}$ of
% intervals. Since the intervals $\imposs=\left[0,0\right]$ and
% $\necess=\left[1,1\right]$ should be included in $\mathscr{I}$, and
% arithmetic operations on intervals
% satisfy \begin{subequations}\label{eq:interval-operations}
% \begin{eqnarray}
%  &  & [l_{1},r_{1}]+[l_{2},r_{2}]=[l_{1}+l_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]\textrm{ and}\\
%  &  & x[l,r]=\begin{cases}
% [xl,xr] & \textrm{for }x\ge0\,;\\{}
% [xr,xl] & \textrm{for }x\le0\,.
% \end{cases}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \end{subequations} $\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$ is
% defined by the axioms: 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\left[0,0\right]$. 
% \item $\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]$. 
% \item $\bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=\left[1,1\right]-\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)$. 
% \item For a set of mutually orthogonal projections $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$,
% $P_{i}P_{j}=\delta_{ij}P_{i}$, we have 
% \begin{equation}
% \bar{\mu}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i}\right)\subseteq\sum_{i=1}^{N}\bar{\mu}\left(P_{i}\right)\label{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}
% \end{equation}
% \end{itemize}
% condition that provides only a bound and not an equivalence as in
% Eq.~\eqref{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}. For example, if we consider
% $\left\{ P_{1},P_{2}\right\} =\left\{ P,\mathbb{1}-P\right\} $ and
% $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[l,r\right]$, we have, when $r-l=\ell>0$,
% \[
% \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]\subsetneq\left[1-\ell,1+\ell\right]=\bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P\right).
% \]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Intervals of Uncertainty}
  \label{sec:Interval-Uncertainty}
We will start by reviewing IVPMs in the classical setting and then
propose our quantum generalization. In the classical setting, there
are several proposals for ``imprecise
probabilities''~\citep{Dempster1967,Shafer1976,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Weichselberger2000,JamisonLodwick2004,HuberRonchetti2009,Grabisch2016}.
Although these proposals differ in some details, they all share the
fact that the probability $\mu(E)$ of an event~$E$ is generalized from
a single real number to an interval\nb$[\ell,r]$
where\nb$\ell$ intuitively corresponds to the strength of evidence for
the event and~$1-r$ corresponds to the strength of evidence against the
event. The collection of intervals used in the definition of a
probability measure must satisfy certain properties that we explain
next.

First, for each interval $[\ell,r]$ we have the natural constraint
$0 \leq \ell \leq r \leq 1$ that guarantees that every element of the
interval can be interpreted as a conventional probability. We also
include $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ as limiting intervals to
refer to the probability of impossible events (e.g., the null event)
and certain events (e.g., the event covering the entire sample space).
For each interval $[\ell,r]$, we also need the interval
$[1-r,1-\ell]$ so that if one interval refers to the probability of an
event, the other refers to the probability of the event's complement.
For example, if we discover as a result of an experiment that
$\mu(E) = [0.2,0.3]$ for some event~$E$, we may conclude that
$\mu(\overline{E}) = [0.7,0.8]$ for the complementary event
$\overline{E}$. In addition to these simple conditions, there are some
subtle conditions on how intervals are combined, which we discuss
next.

Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be two disjoint events with probabilities
$\mu(E_1)=[\ell_1,r_1]$ and $\mu(E_2)=[\ell_2,r_2]$. A first attempt
at calculating the probability of the combined event that \emph{either} $E_1$
or $E_2$ occurs might be $\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$. In
some cases, this is indeed a sensible definition. For example, if
$\mu(E_1)=[0.1,0.2]$ and $\mu(E_2)=[0.3,0.4]$ we get
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [0.4,0.6]$. But consider an event $E$ such that
$\mu(E)=[0.2,0.3]$ and hence $\mu(\overline{E})=[0.7,0.8]$. The two
events $E$ and $\overline{E}$ are disjoint; the previous naïve way
of combining the intervals would give $\mu(E\cup\overline{E})=[0.9,1.1]$
which is not a valid probability interval. Moreover the event
$E\cup\overline{E}$ is the identity event covering the entire space; its
probability interval should be $[1,1]$ which is sharper than
$[0.9,1.1]$. The problem is that the two intervals are correlated:
there is more information in the combined event than in each event
separately. In our example, even though the true probability of
$\mu(E)$ can be anywhere in the range $[0.2,0.3]$ and the true
probability of $\mu(\overline{E})$ can be in anywhere in the range
$[0.7,0.8]$, the values are not independent. Any value of
$\mu(E) \leq 0.25$ will force $\mu(\overline{E})\geq 0.75$. To account
for such subtleties, the axioms of interval-valued probability do not
use a strict equality for the combination of disjoint events. The
correct constraint regarding the probability of $E_1\cup E_2$ when $E_1$
and $E_2$ are disjoint is
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) \subseteq [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$ which, in combination
with the requirement for the identity event would force
$\mu(E\cup\overline{E})$ to always be $[1,1]$ irrespective of the
particular assignments of $\mu(E)$ or $\mu(\overline{E})$. 

When combining non-disjoint events, there is a further subtlety whose
resolution will give us one final general condition. For
general, not necessarily disjoint, events $E_1$ and $E_2$, we have:
\begin{equation}
\mu(E_1\cup E_2) + \mu(E_1\cap E_2) \subseteq \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2)
\label{eq:classicalconvex}
\end{equation}
which is a generalization of the classical inclusion-exclusion
principle that uses $\subseteq$ instead of $=$ for the same reason as
before. The new condition, known as
\emph{convexity}\nb\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Grabisch2016},
reduces to the previously
motivated condition when the events are disjoint, i.e., when
$\mu(E_1\cap E_2) = 0$.

We now have the necessary ingredients to define QIVPMs as a
generalization of both classical IVPMs and conventional quantum
probability measures. We will show that the quantum IVPM will reduce to
the classical IVPM when the space of quantum events is restricted to
mutually commuting sub-events.

\begin{definition}[QIVPM]
  Assume a collection of intervals $\mathscr{I}$ including
  $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ with addition and scalar
  multiplication defined as follows:
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:interval-operations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
   &  & [\ell_{1},r_{1}]+[\ell_{2},r_{2}]=[\ell_{1}+\ell_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]\textrm{ and}\\
   &  & x[\ell,r]=\begin{cases}
  [x\ell,xr] & \textrm{for }x\ge0\,;\\{}
  [xr,x\ell] & \textrm{for }x\le0\,.
  \end{cases}
  \end{eqnarray}
  \end{subequations}
  Then we take a QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}$ to be an assignment of an interval to each
  event (projection operator\nb$P$) subject to the following constraints:
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:QIVPM-constraints}
  \begin{eqnarray}
   &  & \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\left[0,0\right]\,,\\
   &  & \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]\,,\\
   &  & \bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=\left[1,1\right]-\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\,,
  \end{eqnarray}
  \end{subequations}
  and satisfying for each pair of \emph{commuting} projections $P_0$ and $P_1$,
  ($P_0P_1=P_1P_0$)
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\,.
\label{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
The first three constraints, Eq.\nb(\ref{eq:QIVPM-constraints}), are the direct
counterpart of the corresponding ones for conventional interval probability
measures.
With the understanding that the union of classical sets $E_1\cup E_2$ is replaced
by $P_0+P_1-P_0P_1$ in the case of quantum projection
operators~\cite{Griffiths2003}, the last condition, Eq.~(\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}), is
a direct counterpart of Eq.~(\ref{eq:classicalconvex}).

Contrary to the case with conventional quantum probability spaces,
there is generally no unique state consistent with a QIVPM. Given
observations done with finite resources, the probabilities become
intervals, and we say a state\nb$\rho$ is consistent with the
measure\nb$\bar{\mu}$ acting on a projector\nb$P$ if
$\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)$,
where $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)=\Tr\left(\rho P\right)$
is the probability that the event\nb$P$ happens determined by the
Born rule\nb\citep{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199}. Given a set
of projectors\nb$S$, 
\begin{equation}
\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S\right)=\set{\textrm{mixed state }\rho}{\forall P\in S\ \mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)}
\end{equation}
is the set of all mixed states consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on every
projector in $S$. For example, assuming the three intervals $\imposs=\left[0,0\right]$,
$\necess=\left[1,1\right]$, and $\unknown=\left[0,1\right]$, then:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}_{1}\left(P\right)=\begin{cases}
\imposs\,, & \text{if }P=\mathbb{0}\text{ ;}\\
\necess\,, & \text{if }P=\mathbb{1}\text{ ;}\\
\unknown\,, & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}\label{eq:no-information-IVPM}
\end{equation}
is a QIVPM. This measure represents the beliefs of an experimenter
with no prior knowledge about the particular quantum system in question;
any quantum state would be consistent with $\bar{\mu}_{1}$ on any
projectors, and $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{1},\events\right)$ is
just the set of all mixed states.

Quantum IVPMs become classical IVPMs when the space of events includes
only mutually commuting events. We define $\events'\subseteq\events$
to be a sub-event space if it satisfies the following conditions.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\left\{ \mathbb{0},\mathbb{1}\right\} \subseteq\events'$.
\item For any projection\nb$P\in\events'$, we have $\mathbb{1}-P\in\events'$. 
\item For each pair of orthogonal projections\nb$P_0 \in \events'$ and
  $P_1 \in \events'$, we have $(P_0 + P_1) \in \events'$. 
\end{itemize}

For example, $\events_{0}=\left\{ \mathbb{0},\proj{0},\proj{1},\mathbb{1}\right\} $
is a commuting sub-event space. Consider $\bar{\mu}_{1}$ defined
in the previous paragraph. Restricting $\bar{\mu}_{1}$ to
$\events_{0}$, $\bar{\mu}_{1}|_{\events_{0}}$, gives a classical
IVPM~$\bar{\mu}_{2}$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{0}) & =\imposs & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{0}) & =\unknown\\
\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{1}) & =\necess & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{1}) & =\unknown
\end{aligned}
\,.
\end{equation}
If we identify the density matrices\nb$\proj{0}$ and $\proj{1}$ as
the head and the tail of a coin, respectively, then $\bar{\mu}_{2}$
represents the situation in which that an experimenter knows nothing about a
coin before she tosses it. Moreover, for each $p\in\left[0,1\right]$, the mixed
state\nb$p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$ represents a classical
coin with probability\nb$p$ to get heads, and
$p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$ is consistent with $\bar{\mu}_{2}$ on $\events_{0}$ because any
classical coin should be consistent with the situation for which an experimenter
has no prior knowledge.

\section{Kochen-Specker} 
  \label{sec:Kochen-Specker}
  
Our first result is that a QIVPM is consistent with the inability to avoid
uncertainty found in conventional infinite precise quantum
mechanics\nb\cite{PeresRon1988,peres1995quantum}. We will adapt
the proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem\nb\cite{kochenspecker1967,
  peres1995quantum,Redhead1987-REDINA,Griffiths2003} to show that it
is, in general, impossible to have just the two intervals \imposs\ and
\necess: every QIVPM must be parameterized by a collection of
intervals that includes at least one additional ``fuzzy'' interval and
some events must be associated with such uncertain intervals. The
significance of this observation is that the uncertainty in the
intervals is, in contrast to the classical case, \emph{a fundamental
  part of quantum theory}. There are in fact two sources of
uncertainty: one due to the finite measurement resources and one due
to complementarity, which requires every quantum framework to be truly
probabilistic.

We will proceed by assuming a cryptodeterministic QIVMP $\bar{\mu}$
and derive a contradiction using the following nine ``Mermin-Peres square''
observables $\mathbf{O}_{ij}$\nb\cite{Mermin1990Simple,peres1995quantum}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
$\mathbb{1}\otimes\sigma_{z}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\mathbb{1}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
$\sigma_{x}\otimes\mathbb{1}$  & $\mathbb{1}\otimes\sigma_{x}$  & $\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{x}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
$\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{z}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{x}$  & $\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}\,,
\par\end{center}

\noindent where $\left\{\mathbb{1},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y},\sigma_{z}\right\}$ are
Pauli matrices acting on a pair of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ state. We now define the
expectation value of the QIVPM for our Mermin-Peres square.

\begin{definition}Given a Hilbert space of dimension\nb$d\ge3$, for every
  QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, any
  observable\nb$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral decomposition
  $\mathbf{O}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}P_{i}$, and any minimal
  sub-event space $\events'$ containing
  $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$, we have
\begin{equation}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\left[\min_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho},\max_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho}\right]\,.\label{eq:quantum-interval-expectation-core}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

The expectation value is intuitively between two possible outcomes,
which themselves lie between the minimum and maximum bounds of the given
probability intervals. (This definition is consistent with the
classical Choquet integral on commuting sub-event spaces by adopting
the classical
results\nb\cite{GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}.)
If the QIVPM is cryptodeterministic, this interval collapses to a
singleton $\left\{ \lambda\right\} $, where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue
of~$\mathbf{O}$. If we define the multiplication of two singleton
sets\nb$\left\{ \lambda_{1}\right\} $ and
$\left\{ \lambda_{2}\right\} $ to be
$\left\{ \lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\right\} $, then we have
\begin{equation}
\prod_{j=1}^{N}\expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\expval{\prod_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}\label{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}
\end{equation}
for any set of commuting observables\nb$\left\{ \mathbf{O}_{j}\right\}
_{j=1}^{N}$.

Since the expectation value\nb$\expval{\cdot}_{\bar{\mu}}$ satisfies
these two properties, the observables in the Mermin-Peres square must
have the the expectation value\nb$\left\{ 1\right\} $ or
$\left\{ -1\right\} $.  In each row and column, the operators commute,
and each operator is the product of two others, except in the
third column, where
$\left(\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}\right)\left(\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{x}\right)=-\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y}$.
Therefore, it is clearly impossible to find a QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}$ such
that $\langle \mathbf{O}_{ij}\rangle_{\bar \mu}$
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}\langle\mathbb{1} & \otimes\sigma_{z}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{z} & \otimes\mathbb{1}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{z} %& \otimes\sigma_{z}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}}\\
%\langle\sigma_{x} & \otimes\mathbb{1}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\mathbb{1} & \otimes\sigma_{x}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{x} & %\otimes\sigma_{x}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}}\\
%\langle\sigma_{x} & \otimes\sigma_{z}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{z} & \otimes\sigma_{x}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{y} & %\otimes\sigma_{y}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}}
%\end{aligned}
%\label{eq:MerminSquare-values}
%\end{equation}
satisfies Eq.~(\ref{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}).

The question now is what happens if we relax the perfect measurement
assumption that the intervals are precisely $[0,0]$ and
$[1,1]$. We need to examine what happens if
measurement imperfections occasionally cause an
ideally impossible event to be detected or an ideally certain event
not to be detected. Mermin argues in this case that:
\begin{quote}
  \ldots although the outcomes deduced from such imperfect
  measurements will occasionally differ dramatically from those
  allowed in the ideal case, if the misalignment is very slight, the
  statistical distribution of outcomes will differ only slightly from
  the ideal case~\citep{Mermin1999}.
\end{quote}

We can formally test this hypothesis by considering the notion of
a $\delta$-deterministic QIVPM below. 

\begin{definition}\label{def:delta-deterministic}We define
  QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$
  as $\delta$-deterministic if either
  $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]$ or
  $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[1-\delta,1\right]$ for any
  $P\in\events$.\end{definition}

A cryptodeterministic QIVPM is $0$-deterministic.  As $\delta$ gets
bigger, the QIVPM allows more and more indeterminate behavior. A
$\frac{1}{3}$-deterministic QIVPM can be given by
$\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[x/3,x/3\right]$, where $P$ projects
onto an $x$-dimensional subspace of a three-dimensional Hilbert space.

We now prove that for small enough $\delta$, the Kochen-Specker result is
still valid, i.e., if the measurement imperfections are small enough,
we cannot nullify the Kochen-Specker theorem as
Meyer~\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751} argued. 

\begin{thm}\label{cor:Kochen-Specker-IVPM} Given a Hilbert space
  of dimension\nb$d\ge3$, there is no $\delta$-deterministic QIVPM for
  $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$.\end{thm}

\begin{proof} Suppose there is a $\delta$-deterministic
  QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, we claim that the
  following function\nb$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}:\events\rightarrow\left\{
    \imposs,\necess\right\} $ is a cryptodeterministic QIVPM:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P\right)=\begin{cases}
\imposs\,, & \textrm{ if }\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]\:;\\
\necess\,, & \textrm{ if }\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[1-\delta,1\right]\:.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
However, since we know that there is no cryptodeterministic QIVPM,
$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}$ cannot exist and hence $\bar{\mu}$ cannot
exist.

It remains to verify that $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}$ is a cryptodeterministic
QIVPM by checking the properties of
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}\right)=\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{1}\right)=\imposs\\
 & \Rightarrow & \bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)=\imposs
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}for orthogonal operators\nb$P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$.

When $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}\right)=\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{1}\right)=\imposs$,
we have both $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)$ and $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]$
which implies $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)\subseteq\left[0,2\delta\right]$.
Since $\delta<\frac{1}{3}\Rightarrow2\delta<1-\delta$, $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$
cannot be a subset of $\left[1-\delta,1\right]$, but $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$
is a subset of either $\left[0,\delta\right]$ or $\left[1-\delta,1\right]$.
Hence, $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$ must be a subset of $\left[0,\delta\right]$,
which implies $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)=\imposs$. Thus the
theorem holds when $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Gleason}
  \label{sec:Gleason}
In the classical setting, measurements done with limited resources and
poor precision may not uniquely identify the true state of a
system. However, there is always at least one state that is consistent
with the imprecise
measurements~\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:Shapley}
  For a QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, if a
  sub-event space\nb$\events'\subseteq\events$ commutes, then
  $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)\ne\emptyset$.
\end{thm}

In the idealized situation of real-valued quantum probability
measures, Gleason's theorem asserts that every measure is determined
by a unique mixed state. The theorem above is weaker: it
asserts that, for each classical sub-event subspace, a QIVPM must be
consistent with \emph{some} state. But the states consistent with
different subspaces may be incomparable, as the following example
shows.

\begin{example}\label{ex:three-dimensional-three-value}
  Given a three-dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis
  $\left\{ \ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\right\} $,  let
  $\mathscr{I}_{1}=\left\{ \necess,\imposs,\unknown\right\} $,
  $\ket{\ps}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{1}\right)/\sqrt{2}$,
  $\ket{\ps'}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{2}\right)/\sqrt{2}$, and
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \begin{aligned}\imposs & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps'})\,,
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \begin{aligned}\necess & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps'})\,,
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \unknown=\bar{\mu}(P)\qquad\textrm{otherwise.}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
It is straightforward to verify that $\bar{\mu}$
is a QIVPM. Now let $S_{1}=\left\{ \proj{0},\proj{\ps}\right\} $.
Because $\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\imposs$, we have
$\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{0})=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{\ps})=0$
for any mixed state\nb$\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{1}\right)$.
Hence, $\rho$ cannot be any state other than $\ket{2}$, the only
pure state orthogonal to both $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{\ps}$, and it
is easy to verify $\proj{2}$ is actually in $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{1}\right)$.
Similarly, let $S_{2}=\left\{ \proj{0},\proj{\ps'}\right\} $. We
have $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{2}\right)=\left\{ \proj{1}\right\} $.
Therefore, 
\begin{equation}
\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events\right)\subseteq\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{1}\right)\cap\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{2}\right)=\emptyset
\end{equation}
Thus, there is no state that is consistent with the QIVPM on all projectors\nb$\events$,
so Gleason's theorem does not hold for at least this example.
\end{example}

Although Gleason's theorem does not hold for every QIVPM, we can show
that for a certain class of QIVPMs, the collection of states
consistent with the projectors get closer and closer to each other as
the intervals get narrower and narrower, eventually collapsing to a
single state when the intervals become infinitely precise real
numbers. To state this result, we introduce a few technical notions. 

We call a state $\rho$ a \emph{totally mixed state} if
$0<\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)<1$ for any
$P\in\events\backslash\left\{ \mathbb{0},\mathbb{1}\right\} $. We also
define a notion of distance based on the following norm of a
matrix\nb$A$ as
$\left\Vert A\right\Vert
=\max_{\ip{\psi}{\psi}=1}\left|\melem{\psi}{A}{\psi}\right|$\nb\citep{544199}. Now
consider the following collection of intervals:
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\mathscr{I}}_{n} & = & \set{\left[\frac{k-1}{2n},\frac{k+1}{2n}\right]\cap\left[0,1\right]}{k=0,\ldots,2n}\nonumber \\
 &  & \cup\left\{ \left[0,0\right],\left[1,1\right]\right\} 
\end{eqnarray}
which are overlapping intervals with length\nb$1/n$ except the intervals
at each end. 

A totally mixed state induces a QIVPM over the intervals above as
follows. We first define a map $\widehat{\iota}_{n}$ from the interval
$[0,1]$ to the collection of intervals as:
\begin{itemize}
\item when $x=0$ or $x=1$, $\widehat{\iota}_{n}\left(x\right)=\left[x,x\right]$;
\item when $0<x<1$, $\widehat{\iota}_{n}\left(x\right)=\left[\frac{k-1}{2n},\frac{k+1}{2n}\right]\cap\left[0,1\right]$,
where $k$ is defined by one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $k$ even and $k-0.5\le2nx\le k+0.5$;
\item $k$ odd and $k-0.5<2nx<k+0.5$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

It is now not difficult to verify that for any totally mixed
state\nb$\rho$ on a three-dimensional Hilbert space,
$\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ is a
QIVPM. Furthermore, we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\left\Vert \rho-\rho'\right\Vert \le1/\left(12n\right)$,
$\rho'\in\coreBorn\left(\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}},\events\right)$.
\item If $\rho'\in\coreBorn\left(\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}},\events\right)$,
then $\left\Vert \rho-\rho'\right\Vert \le1/n$.
\end{itemize}
In other words, for the states consistent with this QIVPM,
$\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ will become closer and
closer to $\rho'$ as $n$ goes to infinity. In the limiting case when
the intervals are infinitely precise, i.e.,
$\set{\left[x,x\right]}{x\in\left[0,1\right]}$, any QIVPM can be
recast as a real-valued one and will have a unique state consistent
with it on every projector when $d\ge3$.

% In general, this kind of inconsistency can be reduced if we increase
% the measurement resource, that is, using finer intervals. We conjecture
% by using finer and finer intervals, it would be more and more likely
% that there is a state consistent with a QIVPM on all projectors\nb$\events$.
% We can define an interval-valued function\nb
% :\left[0,1\right]\rightarrow\widehat{\mathscr{I}}_{n}$
% by the following:

% if a QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}$ is induced by a totally mixed
% state\nb$\rho$ nicely, then whether another density
% matrix\nb$\rho'\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)$ can be
% estimated by $\left\Vert \rho-\rho'\right\Vert
% $, where a
% state\nb$\rho$ is called totally mixed if
% $0<\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)<1$ for any
% $P\in\events\backslash\left\{ \mathbb{0},\mathbb{1}\right\}
% $, and the the norm of a matrix\nb$A$ is defined by $\left\Vert
%   A\right\Vert
% =\max_{\ip{\psi}{\psi}=1}\left|\melem{\psi}{A}{\psi}\right|$\nb\citep{544199}.
% For example, consider the intervals

% \subsection{Kochen-Specker}

% While mapping to $\mathscr{I}_{\infty}$ is one extreme case of quantum
% IVPMs, mapping to $\mathscr{I}_{\mathrm{D}}=\left\{ \imposs,\necess\right\} $
% is another one, corresponding to the Kochen-Specker theorem\nb\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum,Redhead1987-REDINA,Griffiths2003}.
% We will use the essential idea of the Kochen-Specker theorem to prove
% there is no quantum IVPM mapping to $\mathscr{I}_{\mathrm{D}}=\left\{ \imposs,\necess\right\} $.
% Suppose there is a quantum IVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}_{\mathrm{D}}$.
% We can prove $\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}}$ is a singleton set\nb$\left\{ \lambda\right\} $,
% where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{O}$. If we define the
% multiplication of two singleton sets\nb$\left\{ \lambda_{1}\right\} $
% and $\left\{ \lambda_{2}\right\} $ to be $\left\{ \lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\right\} $,
% then we have 
% \begin{equation}
% \prod_{j=1}^{N}\expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\expval{\prod_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}\label{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}

% must have the the expectation value\nb$\left\{ 1\right\} $ or $\left\{ -1\right\} $.

\section{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:Conclusion}
  
Foundational concepts in quantum mechanics, such as the Kochen-Specker and
Gleason theorems, rely in a very subtle way on the use of
unbounded resources. By assuming infinitely precise measurements,
these two insightful theorems underlie two fundamental aspects of
quantum mechanics. On the one hand, Kochen-Specker's result reveals a
distinctive aspect of physical reality, the fact that it is contextual, and, on the other hand, Gleason's theorem establishes a relationship between quantum states and probabilities uniquely defined
by Born's rule.  Our goal
in this paper has been to analyze the physical consequences of a
mathematical framework that allows for finite precision measurements
by introducing the concept of quantum interval-valued probability. This
framework incorporates uncertainty in the measurement results by defining
fuzzy probability measures, and includes standard quantum measurement
as the particular instance of sharp, infinitely precise, intervals.
In addition, we showed how these two theorems emerge as limiting cases
of this same framework, thus connecting two seemingly unrelated
aspects of quantum physics. We noted that
{\it arbitrary\/} finite precision measurement conditions can nullify the main
tenets of both theorems. However, by carefully specifying experimental uncertainties, we were able to establish rigorous bounds on the validity of these two theorems. Therefore, we have established a context in which infinite precision quantum mechanical theories can be reconciled with finite precision quantum mechanical measurements, and have provided a possible resolution of the Meyer-Mermin debate on the impact of finite precision on the Kochen-Specker theorem \cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Mermin1999}.

% To adapt the axioms of such IVPMs to the quantum case, we proceed as
% follows. First we fix a collection of intervals $\mathscr{I}$ that
% represents an abstraction of the available experimental resources. At
% one extreme, infinitely precise resources would correspond to the
% collection of intervals $\{[x,x] \mid x \in [0,1]\}$. This case should
% coincide with the idealized situation above. At another extreme, an
% experiment with ``minimal'' resources would correspond to the
% following three intervals $\imposs=\left[0,0\right]$,
% $\necess=\left[1,1\right]$, and $\unknown=[0,1]$. As before, the first
% two intervals are associated with the empty projection and the
% identity projection but every other projection would be associated
% with $\unknown$; its probability can be anything in the range
% $[0,1]$. A third special situation would be to consider IVPMs with
% only the two intervals $\imposs=\left[0,0\right]$ and
% $\necess=\left[1,1\right]$. This is what Peres calls the
% \emph{cryptodeterministic} case in which there is no ambiguity about
% the status of any event; we know for certain if it will occur or not.

% \begin{definition}
% $\bar{\mu}$ is called convex. if for all
% commuting $P_{0},P_{1}\in\events$, we have
% $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)$.
% \end{definition}

% Consider again
% Eq.~\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}. We will
% generalize it as follows for all commuting $P_{0},P_{1}\in\events$, we
% have
% $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)$. Note
% that if $P_0$ and $P_1$ are \emph{orthogonal}, i.e., if $P_0P_1=0$ the
% new equation reduces to
% Eq.~\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}.

% Now we need a simple classical example that shows 
% why we need convexity or at least what it means

% must be dimension 4 because everything of dim 3 
% is convex in classical case

% Consider omega = { 0, 1, 2, 3 }
% intervals = imposssible, certain, 
%             unlikely = [0,0.5], likely [0.5,1] 

% mu(empty) = imposs
% mu(omega) = certain
% mu({j}) = unlikely
% mu(Omega \ {j}) = likely
% mu({0,1}) = mu({0,2}) = mu({1,2}) = unlikely
% mu({0,3}) = mu({1,3}) = mu({2,3}) = likely

% EQ A:
% mu({0}) + mu({0,1,2}) = [0.5,1.5]
% mu({0,1}) + mu({0,2}) = [0,1]

% AND [0.5,1.5] is not subseteq of [0,1]

% Note that there is a core p(0) = p(1) = p(2) = 0.2, 
% p(3) = 0.4, and under that core both sides of EQ A 
% have prob. 0.8. So one way to make it convex is 
% to use very precise intervals [0.2,0.2] etc. 

% Another way to make this convex is by choosing 
% just one additional interval unknown [0,1] 
% instead of unlikely and likely.

% Intuition: the more you group the more 
% precise you get

% In the classical setting, IVPMs typically are equipped with additional
% conditions to ensure they are ``well-behaved.''

% Formally, we can ask: what can we deduce about the state of a quantum
% system given a quantum IVPM, i.e., given observations done with finite
% resources. Since the probabilities are now intervals, it is intuitive
% to say a state\nb$\rho$ is consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on a projector\nb$P$
% if $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)$,
% and denoted by $\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\left\{ P\right\} \right)$.
% Moreover, $\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S\right)$ means $\rho$
% is consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on every projector in $S$.

% Consider a quantum IVPM $\bar{\mu}$ such that $\mul:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$
% and $\mur:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$ are the left-end and
% the right-end of $\bar{\mu}$, respectively, i.e., $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[\mul\left(P\right),\mur\left(P\right)\right]$
% for all $P\in\events$. This time, when we express an observable as
% its spectral decomposition
% \begin{equation}
% \mathbf{O}=\sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\lambda_{i}^{s}P_{i}^{s}\,,\label{eq:spectrum-decomposition}
% \end{equation}
% we separate the positive and negative eigenvalues and order its eigenvalues
% from the smallest to the largest 
% \begin{equation}
% \lambda_{N^{-}}^{-}\le\ldots\le\lambda_{1}^{-}\le0\le\lambda_{1}^{+}\le\ldots\le\lambda_{N^{+}}^{+}\,.
% \end{equation}
% Let $P_{i}^{s\prime}=\sum_{j\ge i}P_{j}^{s}$ and $\Delta\mu^{*}\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)=\mu^{*}\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)-\mu^{*}\left(P_{i+1}^{s\prime}\right)$,
% where $s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} $ and $\mu^{*}\in\left\{ \mul,\mur\right\} $.
% We can combine the classical Choquet integral\nb\cite{Vitali1925,Choquet1954,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}
% with Eq.~(\ref{eq:quantum-expectation}) and define the expectation
% value of $\mathbf{O}$ with respect to $\bar{\mu}$ as
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}} & = & \sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\lambda_{i}^{s}\left[\Delta\mul\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right),\Delta\mur\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)\right]\,.\label{eq:quantum-interval-expectation}

% For example, given a three dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal
% basis $\left\{ \ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\right\} $. Let $J_{\mathrm{z}}=\proj{0}-\proj{2}$,
% and $\mathbf{O}_{1}=2\mathbb{1}-J_{\mathrm{z}}^{2}=2\proj{1}+\proj{0}+\proj{2}$.
% By following Table~\ref{table:quantum-interval-expectation}, we
% have 
% \begin{equation}
% \expval{\mathbf{O}_{1}}_{\bar{\mu}_{1}}=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\lambda_{i}^{+}\left[\Delta\mul\left(P_{i}^{+\prime}\right),\Delta\mur\left(P_{i}^{+\prime}\right)\right]=\left[1,2\right]\,.
% \end{equation}
% The expectation value is intuitively between two possible outcomes,
% $1$ and $2$, even if we have no prior knowledge about the likelihood
% of outcomes. In contrast, if we naively multiply eigenvalues with
% intervals, their sum, $\sum_{i=1}^{2}\lambda_{i}^{+}\bar{\mu}_{1}\left(P_{i}^{+}\right)=\left[0,3\right]$,
% is a worse and counter-intuitive estimation. In fact, estimating the
% lower-bound by $1\cdot0+2\cdot0=0$ is too pessimistic because we
% know one of outcomes must happen without any prior knowledge.

% Intuitively, the expectation value of an observable with respect to a
% QIVPM is bounded by the minimum and maximum expectation value of the
% same observable with respect to states consistent with it. This is
% true when we require our IVPM to be convex, and on a commuting
% sub-event space induced by an observable.

\begin{abstract}
We present a mathematical framework based on quantum interval-valued
probability measures to study the effect of experimental imperfections
and finite precision measurements on defining aspects of quantum
mechanics such as contextuality and the Born rule. While foundational
results such as the Kochen-Specker and Gleason theorems fail to hold
in general in a world with limited resources, when we allow infinite
precision, their validity is recovered.  However, we are able to use
the interval-valued framework to establish bounds on the validity of
those theorems in realistic experimental environments. In this way,
not only can we quantify the idea of finite-precision measurement
within our theory, but we can also suggest a possible resolution of
the Meyer-Mermin debate on the impact of finite-precision measurement
on the Kochen-Specker theorem.

\section{Introduction}

There are long-standing debates in the foundations of quantum
mechanics regarding the tension between finite precision measurement
and contextuality~\cite{BarrettKent2004,Appleby_2005}. The outcome
of a theory that is contextual depends upon
whether  compatible sets of observables are measured together or
separately; a non-contextual theory gives the same results in either
case.  A classic example of the varying opinions on the impact of
imprecision is the disagreement between
Meyer~\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751} and 
Mermin~\cite{Mermin1999}  on whether finite-precision
measurements invalidate the spirit of the Kochen-Specker
theorem~\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum}.  The Kochen-Specker  
theorem is in essence a
mathematical statement about contextuality, asserting that
in a Hilbert space of dimension $d \ge 3$, it is
impossible to associate definite measured values, $\mu(P_i)= 0$ or
$1$, with every projection operator~$P_i$, in such a way that, if a
set of commuting $P_i$ satisfies $\sum_i P_i = 1$, then
$\sum_i \mu(P_i) = 1$.   Meyer showed that one {\it can\/}
assign definite values $0$ or $1$ to the measurement outcome
$\mu(P_i)$ when the Hilbert space is defined over the field of
rational numbers, therefore nullifying the
theorem~\citep{PhysRevLett.83.3751}.  However, Mermin then argued
that measurement outcomes must depend smoothly on slight changes in
the experimental configuration, leading him to assert that the
impact of Meyer's negative result is
``unsupportable''~\citep{Mermin1999}.  The debate on
whether contextuality is consistent with experimental
outcomes continues to be an active topic of research~\citep{Kent1999,HavlicekKrennSummhammerSvozil2001,SimonBruknerZeilinger2001,Cabello2002,Larsson2002,Appleby2002,BarrettKent2004,Appleby_2005,Spekkens2005,GuehneKleinmannCabelloEtAl2010,MazurekPuseyKunjwalEtAl2016}.

The question of how to address this controversy is therefore a
fundamental problem.  How does one
develop mathematical theories of quantum mechanics that are
intrinsically, rather than only implicitly, consistent with the
resources available for the realistic accuracy of an actual
measurement?   In this paper, we extend our previous work on the
foundations of computability in quantum physics by exploring the
application of interval-valued probability measures (IVPMs) to
achieving a coherent formulation of finite-resource quantum mechanics.
From this starting point, we develop a mathematical framework that includes the
uncertainties of finite precision and imperfections in the quantum
measurement process.  In particular, we are able to quantify the concept of
imperfect quantum measurement and its impact on the interpretation of
the Kochen-Specker and Gleason theorems and their implications for the
foundations of quantum mechanics.  We have reason to believe that
essential objectives of our program to achieve a computable theory of
quantum mechanics and finite-resource measurement, attempted
previously with computable number
systems~\cite{usat,geometry2013apsrev4,DQT2014}, may be achievable by
extending classical IVPMs~\cite{JamisonLodwick2004} to the quantum
domain.  We thus begin by axiomatizing a quantum interval-valued
probability measure (QIVPM) framework.

A principal result is that recasting the Kochen-Specker theorem in
terms of ``$\delta$-determinism'', with~$\delta$ 
quantifying the effect of finite-precision uncertainties on measurement 
outcomes, reducing to the purely deterministic
Kochen-Specker case for $\delta=0$, can resolve the question of effect
of finite precision and imperfections on contextuality.  A remarkable
consequence of our analysis is that not only does the
quantum-mechanical requirement for contextuality continue to hold,
thus maintaining the Kochen-Specker result for a \emph{non-vanishing}
range of $\delta$, but that at a \emph{certain fixed value} of
$\delta$, there is a sharp transition, parallel in its consequences
to, say, a phase transition, to \emph{non-contextuality}; that is,
quantum mechanics suddenly fails to hold, and all variables can be
specified simultaneously, turning the theory effectively into a
classical theory that can be specified consistently by hidden
variables.  
\yutsung{The part after ``that is'' looks strange.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Kochen-Specker theorem is not about quantum mechanics, is about whether
quantum mechanics can be simulated by a non-contextual deterministic hidden
variable theory or not. Hence, ``quantum mechanics suddenly fails to hold''
doesn't make a lot sense.
\item The question is whether there exist a QIVPM means ``a classical theory
consistently by hidden variables.'' At least, a QIVPM is not deterministic, and
I need to check whether it qualities as a classical probabilistic hidden variable
theory\ldots(?)
\end{enumerate}
}
These results provide a new insight into the
Meyer-Mermin debate by presenting a theory in which there is a
\emph{parameter} interpolating between what appeared previously to be
irreconcilable interpretations of contextuality.

We also investigate, though with less insight-generating results, the
second key aspect of imprecise quantum measurement, which is its
statistical nature as reflected in the application of the Born rule
determining the probability of a given measurement
outcome~\citep{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199}.  Here, Gleason's
theorem establishes that there is no alternative to the Born rule by
demonstrating, using reasonable continuity arguments in Hilbert spaces
of dimension $d\ge3$, the existence of a unique state $\rho$
consistent with the statistical predictions computed from that
rule~\citep{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum}.  Our
question then concerns what happens when infinite precision cannot be
achieved.  We are able to show that, while a QIVPM incorporating the
effects of finite precision might not be consistent with Gleason's
unique state~$\rho$ on all projectors defined on a Hilbert space
$\Hilb$ of dimension $d\ge3$, there is a mathematically precise sense
in which one recovers the original Gleason theorem asymptotically.
Specifically, if a set of QIVPMs representing bounded resources
correspond individually to at least one state's~$\rho'$, those states
will converge to a unique state $\rho$ when the size of the intervals
characterizing the uncertainties tends to zero, and the set of
single-point QIVPMs densely covers the entire real interval $[0,1]$.


The paper is organized as follows.  In Sec.~\ref{sec:fuzzy} we begin
by introducing the foundations of quantum probability space and fuzzy
measurement.  We then move on to introduce the concept of quantum
interval valued probability in Sec.~\ref{sec:Interval-Uncertainty}.
The QIVPMs will provide the mathematical framework we need to quantify the
impact of finite precision measurements on quantum mechanics.  For
instance, in Sec.~\ref{sec:Kochen-Specker}, we quantify the domain of
validity of a contextual measurement, thus addressing the conditions
under which the Kochen-Specker theorem applies.  This provides a way
not only of resolving the Meyer-Mermin debate, but also revealing a
precise transition to non-contextuality;  these are the results of our
Thm~\ref{cor:Kochen-Specker-IVPM}.  In Sec.~\ref{sec:Gleason}, we
study Gleason's theorem in the context of imprecise measurements,
concluding that QIVPMs provide a framework with quantitative bounds in
which Gleason's theorem, while formally invalid in a universe with
bounded resources, holds asymptotically in a mathematically precise
way.  Finally, we present our conclusions in Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusion}.

\section{Fuzzy Measurements}
\label{sec:fuzzy}

A \emph{probability space} is a mathematical abstraction specifying
the necessary conditions for reasoning coherently about collections of
uncertain
events~\cite{Kolmogorov1950,544199,Griffiths2003,Grabisch2016}. In the
quantum case, the events of interest are specified by \emph{projection
  operators} $P$. These include the empty projector~$\mathbb{0}$, the
identity projector~$\mathbb{1}$, projectors of the form $\proj{\phi}$
where $\ket{\phi}$ is a pure quantum state (an element of a Hilbert
space), sums of \emph{orthogonal} projectors $P_0$ and~$P_1$ with
$P_0P_1=\mathbb{0}$, and products of \emph{commuting} projectors $P_0$
and~$P_1$ with $P_0P_1=P_1P_0$. In a quantum probability
space~\cite{10.2307/2308516,gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,Maassen2010},
each event~$P_{i}$ is mapped to a probability~$\mu(P_{i})$ using a
probability measure~$\mu:\events\rightarrow[0,1]$, where $\events$ is
the set of all projectors on a given Hilbert space, subject to the
following constraints: $\mu(\mathbb{0})=0$, $\mu(\mathbb{1})=1$,
$\mu\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=1-\mu\left(P\right)$, and for each pair
of \emph{orthogonal} projectors $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$:
\begin{equation}
{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)={\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\,.\label{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}
\end{equation}
Given a probability for every projector, we can associate an
expectation value with an observable~$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral
decomposition $\mathbf{O}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}P_{i}$ as:
\begin{equation}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\mu}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mu(P_{i})\,.\label{eq:quantum-expectation}
\end{equation}

A conventional quantum probability measure can be easily
constructed if one knows the current state of the quantum system by
using the Born rule.  Specifically, for each pure normalized quantum
state~$\ket{\phi}$, the Born rule induces a probability measure
$\mu_{\phi}^{\mathrm{B}}$ defined as
$\mu_{\phi}^{\mathrm{B}}(P)=\ip{\phi}{P\vert\phi}$. The situation
generalizes to mixed states
$\rho = \sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}\proj{\phi_{j}}$, where
$\sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}=1$ in which case the generalized Born rule
induces a probability measure $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ defined as
$\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right) = \Tr\left(\rho P\right) =
\sum_{j=1}^{N}
q_{j}\mu_{\phi_{j}}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)$~\cite{peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}.

As an example, consider a three-dimensional Hilbert space with
orthonormal basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\}$ and an observable
$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral decomposition
$\mathbf{O} = \proj{0} + 2\,\proj{1} + 3\,\proj{2}$. Two fragments of
valid probability measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ that can be associated
with this space are: $\mu_1(\proj{0}) = 0.5$, $\mu_1(\proj{1}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_1(\proj{2}) = 0$, and $\mu_2(\proj{0}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_2(\proj{1}) = 0$, $\mu_2(\proj{2}) = 0.5$. By the Born rule, the
first probability measure corresponds to the quantum system being in
the pure state $\ket{\phi_1}=(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}$ and the
second corresponds to the quantum system being in the pure state
$\ket{\phi_2}=(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{2})/\sqrt{2}$, where in both cases
$|\alpha|=1$. The expectation values of the observable $\mathbf{O}$,
$\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\mu_{1,2}}$, are 1.5 in the first case and 2 in
the second.

The above axioms describe a mathematical idealization involving
infinitely precise measurements. In an actual experimental setup with
an ensemble of quantum states that are not exactly identically
prepared, and with small imperfections and inaccuracies in measuring
devices, an experimenter might only be able to determine that the
probability of the event $\proj{0}$ is in the range $[0.49,0.51]$
instead of precisely 0.5. The spread in this range depends on the
amount of resources (time, energy, money, etc.) that are devoted to
the experiment. In the classical setting, this ``fuzziness'' can be
formalized by moving to \emph{interval-valued probability measures}
(IVPMs), which we explore in the next section, along with our proposed
extension to the quantum domain.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Intervals of Uncertainty}
\label{sec:Interval-Uncertainty}

We will start by reviewing IVPMs in the classical setting and then
propose our quantum generalization. In the classical setting, there
are several proposals for ``imprecise
probabilities''~\citep{Dempster1967,Shafer1976,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Weichselberger2000,JamisonLodwick2004,HuberRonchetti2009,Grabisch2016}.
Although these proposals differ in some details, they all share the
fact that the probability $\mu(E)$ of an event~$E$ is generalized from
a single \emph{real number} to an \emph{interval}~$[\ell,r]$
where~$\ell$ intuitively corresponds to the strength of evidence for
the event~$E$ and~$1-r$ corresponds to the strength of evidence
against the same event. The collection of intervals used in the
definition of a probability measure must satisfy certain properties
that we explain next.

First, for each interval $[\ell,r]$ we have the natural constraint
$0 \leq \ell \leq r \leq 1$ that guarantees that every element of the
interval can be interpreted as a conventional probability. We also
include $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ as limiting intervals to
refer to the probability of impossible events (e.g., the null event)
and events that are certain (e.g., the event covering the entire
sample space).  For each interval $[\ell,r]$, we also need the dual
interval $[1-r,1-\ell]$ so that if one interval refers to the
probability of an event~$E$, the dual refers to the probability of the
event's complement $\overline{E}$.  For example, if we discover as a
result of an experiment that $\mu(E) = [0.2,0.3]$ for some event~$E$,
we may conclude that $\mu(\overline{E}) = [0.7,0.8]$ for the
complement event $\overline{E}$. In addition to these simple
conditions, there are some subtle conditions on how intervals are
combined, which we discuss next.

Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be two disjoint events with probabilities
$\mu(E_1)=[\ell_1,r_1]$ and $\mu(E_2)=[\ell_2,r_2]$. A first attempt
at calculating the probability of the combined event that
\emph{either} $E_1$ or $E_2$ occurs might be
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$. In some cases, this is
indeed a sensible definition. For example, if $\mu(E_1)=[0.1,0.2]$ and
$\mu(E_2)=[0.3,0.4]$ we get $\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [0.4,0.6]$. But
consider an event $E$ such that $\mu(E)=[0.2,0.3]$ and hence
$\mu(\overline{E})=[0.7,0.8]$. The two events $E$ and $\overline{E}$
are disjoint; the naïve addition of intervals would give
$\mu(E\cup\overline{E})=[0.9,1.1]$ which is not a valid probability
interval. Moreover the event $E\cup\overline{E}$ is the identity event
covering the entire space; its probability interval should be $[1,1]$
which is sharper than $[0.9,1.1]$. The problem is that the two
intervals are correlated: there is more information in the combined
event than in each event separately. In our example, even though the
``true'' probability of $E$ can be anywhere in the range $[0.2,0.3]$
and the ``true'' probability of~$\overline{E}$ can be in anywhere in
the range $[0.7,0.8]$, the values are not independent. Any value of
$\mu(E) \leq 0.25$ will force $\mu(\overline{E})\geq 0.75$. To account
for such subtleties, the axioms of interval-valued probability do not
use a strict equality for the combination of disjoint events. The
correct constraint regarding the probability of $E_1\cup E_2$ when
$E_1$ and $E_2$ are disjoint is
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) \subseteq [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$ which, in
combination with the requirement for the identity event would force
$\mu(E \cup \overline{E})$ to always be $[1,1]$ irrespective of the
particular assignments of $\mu(E)$ or~$\mu(\overline{E})$.

When combining non-disjoint events, there is a further subtlety whose
resolution will give us the final general condition for IVPMs. For
general, not necessarily disjoint, events $E_1$ and $E_2$, we have:
\begin{equation}
\mu(E_1\cup E_2) + \mu(E_1\cap E_2) \subseteq \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2)
\label{eq:classicalconvex}
\end{equation}
which is a generalization of the classical inclusion-exclusion
principle that uses $\subseteq$ instead of $=$ for the same reason as
before. The new condition, known as
\emph{convexity}~\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Grabisch2016},
reduces to the previously
motivated condition when the events are disjoint, i.e., when
$\mu(E_1\cap E_2) = 0$.

We now have the necessary ingredients to define the quantum extension,
QIVPMs, as a generalization of both classical IVPMs and quantum
probability measures. We will show that QIVPMs reduce to classical
IVPMs when the space of quantum events is restricted to mutually
commuting events, i.e., to compatible events that can be measured
simultaneously. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Gleason} we will discuss the
connection between QIVPMs and conventional quantum probability
measures.

\begin{definition}[QIVPM]
  Assume a collection of intervals $\mathscr{I}$ including
  $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ with addition and scalar
  multiplication defined as follows:
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:interval-operations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
   &  & [\ell_{1},r_{1}]+[\ell_{2},r_{2}]=[\ell_{1}+\ell_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]\textrm{ and}\\
   &  & x[\ell,r]=\begin{cases}
  [x\ell,xr] & \textrm{for }x\ge0\,;\\{}
  [xr,x\ell] & \textrm{for }x\le0\,.
  \end{cases}
  \end{eqnarray}
  \end{subequations}
  Then we take a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}$ to be an assignment of an interval to each
  event (projection operator~$P$) subject to the following constraints:
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:QIVPM-constraints}
  \begin{eqnarray}
   &  & \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\left[0,0\right]\,,\\
   &  & \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]\,,\\
   &  & \bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=\left[1,1\right]-\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\,,
  \end{eqnarray}
  \end{subequations}
  and satisfying for each pair of \emph{commuting} projectors $P_0$
  and $P_1$ with $P_0P_1=P_1P_0$,
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\,.
\label{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\noindent The first three constraints,
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:QIVPM-constraints}), are the direct counterpart of the
corresponding ones for classical IVPMs.  With the understanding that
the union of classical sets $E_1\cup E_2$ is replaced by
$P_0+P_1-P_0P_1$ in the case of quantum projection
operators~\cite{Griffiths2003}, the last condition,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}), is a
direct counterpart of the convexity condition of
Eq.~(\ref{eq:classicalconvex}). Thus our definition of QIVPMs merges
classical IVPMs with quantum probability measures. 

In the remainder of this section, we will show that our definition of
QIVPMs is consistent with classical IVPMs in the sense that a
restriction of QIVPMs to commuting events recovers the definition of
classical IVPMs. To formalize this connection between QIVPMs and
classical IVPMs, we first note that in contrast to the case with
conventional quantum probability spaces, there is generally no unique
state~$\rho$ consistent with a QIVPM. We say that a QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$
is consistent with a state $\rho$ and projector~$P$ if the interval
$\bar{\mu}(P)$ contains the exact probability calculated by the Born
rule, i.e, if:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)=\Tr\left(\rho P\right)$
is the probability that the event~$P$ is determined by the Born
rule~\citep{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199}.

We generalize this consistency relation to sets of states and general
subspaces of events as follows. A set of events $\events'$ is a
\emph{subspace} if it contains $\mathbb{0}$ and~$\mathbb{1}$ and is
closed under complements and sums, i.e., for any
projector~$P\in\events'$, we have $\mathbb{1}-P\in\events'$ and for
each pair of orthogonal projectors~$P_0 \in \events'$ and
$P_1 \in \events'$, we have $(P_0 + P_1) \in \events'$. Given a
probability measure $\bar{\mu}$ and a subspace of events $\events'$,
we denote the collection of all states that are consistent with
$\bar{\mu}$ on every projector in $\events'$ as
$\coreBorn(\bar{\mu},\events')$:
\begin{equation}
\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)=\set{\rho}{\forall P\in \events',~\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)}.
\end{equation}

The proof that QIVPMs become classical IVPMs when the space of events
includes only mutually commuting events is presented in detail in the
long version of this paper~\cite{HOSTunpublished}. The idea of the
proof is as follows. Given a subspace of commuting events $\events_C$,
we can construct a partial orthonormal basis by diagonalization and
complete it to a full orthonormal basis $\overline{\events_C}$. We
then build a bijection between the QIVPM on the set of projectors
associated with this basis and the set of classical events
corresponding to this basis. This correspondence leads to a crucial
property in our setting.

\begin{thm}[Non-empty Core for Compatible Measurements] \label{thm:Shapley}
  For QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, if a subspace
  of events~$\events_C\subseteq\events$ commutes, then
  $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events_C\right)\ne\emptyset$.
\end{thm}

This theorem follows directly from our
correspondence~\cite{HOSTunpublished} and Shapley's
theorem~\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}, which
proves that a classical IVPM always contains at least one state $\rho$
that is consistent with every event in $\events_C$. In contrast, as we
illustrate in the next section, the set of states
$\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)$ that is consistent with
some arbitrary (not necessarily commuting) events $\events'$ and a
particular QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$ may be \emph{empty}.

For example, a well-defined  
QIVPM, assuming the three intervals $\imposs$, $\necess$, and
$\unknown=\left[0,1\right]$, is:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}_{1}\left(P\right)=\begin{cases}
\imposs\,, & \text{if }P=\mathbb{0}\text{ ;}\\
\necess\,, & \text{if }P=\mathbb{1}\text{ ;}\\
\unknown\,, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\label{eq:no-information-IVPM}
\end{equation}
This measure represents the beliefs of an experimenter with no prior
knowledge about the particular quantum system in question; any quantum
state would be consistent with $\bar{\mu}_{1}$ on any projectors, and
$\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{1},\events\right)$ is just the set of all
states. The subspace
$\events_{0}=\left\{ \mathbb{0},\proj{0},\proj{1},\mathbb{1}\right\} $
is a subspace of commuting events. Indeed restricting $\bar{\mu}_{1}$
to $\events_{0}$, $\bar{\mu}_{1}|_{\events_{0}}$, gives a classical
IVPM~$\bar{\mu}_{2}$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{0}) & =\imposs & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{0}) & =\unknown\\
\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{1}) & =\necess & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{1}) & =\unknown
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
If we identify the states ~$\proj{0}$ and $\proj{1}$ with the head
and the tail of a coin, respectively, then $\bar{\mu}_{2}$ represents
the situation in which that an experimenter knows nothing about a coin
before she tosses it. Moreover, for each $p\in\left[0,1\right]$, the
state~$p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$ represents a classical
coin with probability~$p$ to get heads, and
$p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$ is consistent with
$\bar{\mu}_{2}$ on $\events_{0}$ because any classical coin should be
consistent with the situation for which an experimenter has no prior
knowledge.

We conclude this section with a generalization of expectation values
of observables in the context of QIVPMs. In conventional quantum
mechanics the expectation value of an observable as defined in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:quantum-expectation} is a unique real number. The
generalization to QIVPMs implies that this expectation value will
itself become bounded by an interval. 

\begin{definition}[Expectation Value of Observables over QIVPMs] Let
  $\mathscr{I}$ be a set of intervals; $\Hilb$ a Hilbert space of
  dimension~$d\ge3$ with event space~$\events$; and $\mathbf{O}$ an
  observable with spectral decomposition
  $\Sigma_{i=1}^N \lambda_iP_i$. Let $\events'$ be the minimal
  subspace of events containing all the projectors $P_i$ in the
  spectral decomposition of $\mathbf{O}$, then we define:
\begin{equation}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\left[\min_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}},\max_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}}\right]\,. \label{eq:quantum-interval-expectation-core}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\noindent Intuitively the expectation value of an observable relative
to a QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$ lies between two possible outcomes, which
themselves lie between the minimum and maximum bounds of the
probability intervals associated with each state~$\rho$ that is
consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on every projector in the spectral
decomposition of the observable. If $\bar{\mu}$ is a conventional
(Born) probability measure induced by a state $\rho$, then
$\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)$ will contain the singleton
state $\rho$ and both endpoints of the interval will agree, thus
reducing the definition to that of
Eq.~(\ref{eq:quantum-expectation}). We also note that, when restricted
to commuting projectors, the definition above is consistent with the
classical notion of the \emph{Choquet
  integral}~\cite{GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016} which is used to
calculate the expectation value of random variables as a weighted
average.

\section{Kochen-Specker} 
\label{sec:Kochen-Specker}
  
Our generalization of quantum probability measures to QIVPMs allows us
to strengthen the scope of one of the fundamental theorems of quantum
information: the Kochen-Specker
theorem~\cite{PeresRon1988,peres1995quantum}. Our finite-precision
extension of the theorem will suggest a resolution to the debate
initiated by Meyer and Mermin on the relevance of the Kochen-Specker
to experimental, and hence finite-precision, quantum
measurements~\citep{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Mermin1999,Kent1999,HavlicekKrennSummhammerSvozil2001,SimonBruknerZeilinger2001,Cabello2002,Larsson2002,Appleby2002,BarrettKent2004,Appleby_2005,Spekkens2005,GuehneKleinmannCabelloEtAl2010,MazurekPuseyKunjwalEtAl2016}.
Specifically, the original Kochen-Specker theorem is formulated under
the assumption that all observables of a quantum mechanical system
have \emph{definite values at all times}~\cite{Held2016}. Our
interval-valued probability framework will allow us to state, and
prove, a stronger version of the theorem that holds even if the
observables have values that are only definite up to some specific
parameter that quantifies experimental uncertainty. Put differently,
our stronger statement and theorem quantifies Mermin's
intuition~\citep{Mermin1999}:
\begin{quote}
  \ldots although the outcomes deduced from such imperfect
  measurements will occasionally differ dramatically from those
  allowed in the ideal case, if the misalignment is very slight, the
  statistical distribution of outcomes will differ only slightly from
  the ideal case.
\end{quote}

%\paragraph*{$\delta$-Determinism.} 

The first step in our formalization is to introduce a family of QIVPMs
parameterized by an uncertainty~$\delta$ which we call
$\delta$-deterministic QIVPMs.

\begin{definition}[$\delta$-Determinism]\label{def:delta-deterministic} A
  QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$ is
  $\delta$-deterministic if, for every event $P\in\events$, we have
  that either 
  $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]$ or
  $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[1-\delta,1\right]$. 
\end{definition}

When $\delta=0$ , every event must be assigned a probability in either
the interval $[0,0]$ or $[1,1]$, i.e., every event is completely
determined with certainty. As $\delta$ gets bigger, the QIVPM allows
more and more indeterminate behavior. Our technical result will be
that for ``small enough'' $\delta$, a variant of the Kochen-Specker
theorem is still valid. To state and prove this result we will first
reformulate the original Kochen-Specker as a statement regarding the
non-existence of $0$-deterministic QIVPM. We will then strengthen this
result to show the non-existence of any $\delta$-deterministic QIVPM
when $\delta < 1/3$ and the Hilbert space dimension is greater than
2. 

\amr{Fix below until next marker}

If a QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}$ is 0-deterministic, a family of $M$ commuting
observables\nb$\left\{ \mathbf{O}_{j}\right\} _{j=1}^{M}$ can be
diagonalized by a common orthonormal basis~$\Omega=\left\{ \ket{k}\right\} _{k=0}^{d-1}$.
Since $\bar{\mu}$ is 0-deterministic, there is a quantum probability
measure\nb$\mu$ such that $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left\{ \mu\left(P\right)\right\} $
and $\mu\left(P\right)\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $ for all $P\in\events$\nb\citep{HOSTunpublished}.
Hence, the expectation values of the observables\nb$\expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}$
and the product observables\nb$\expval{\prod_{j=1}^{M}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}$
are equal to the singleton set\nb$\left\{ \expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\mu}\right\} $
and $\left\{ \expval{\prod_{j=1}^{M}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\mu}\right\} $,
respectively, which have an intuitive product rule\nb$\left\{ x_{0}\right\} \cdot\left\{ x_{1}\right\} =\left\{ x_{0}x_{1}\right\} $.
Since $\mu\left(\proj{k}\right)$ is either $0$ or $1$, there exists
an unique $\ket{k_{0}}$ such that $\mu\left(\proj{k_{0}}\right)=1$
and $\mu\left(\proj{k}\right)=0$ for $k\ne k_{0}$, both $\prod_{j=1}^{M}\left\{ \expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\mu}\right\} $
and $\left\{ \expval{\prod_{j=1}^{M}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\mu}\right\} $
are equal to the product of the eigenvalues corresponding to the pure
state\nb$\ket{k_{0}}$ for each observables. Therefore, we have the
following property: 
\begin{equation}
\prod_{j=1}^{M}\expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\expval{\prod_{j=1}^{M}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}\,.\label{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}
\end{equation}

\amr{End marker}

We now state and prove a theorem that is equivalent in scope to the
original Kochen-Specker theorem but that is formulated in terms of
$0$-deterministic QIVPMs.

\begin{thm} [0-Deterministic Variant of
  Kochen-Specker] \label{thm:Kochen-Specker} Given a Hilbert space
  $\Hilb$ of dimension~$d\ge3$, there is no 0-deterministic
  measure~$\bar{\mu}$ mapping every event to either $[0,0]$ or $[1,1]$.
\end{thm}

To explain why this result is equivalent to the original
Kochen-Specker theorem and to prove it at the same time, we proceed by
assuming a 0-deterministic QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$ and derive a
contradiction to the original Kochen-Specker theorem using the same
nine observables $\mathbf{O}_{ij}$ used in the ``Mermin-Peres'' proof
of the Kochen-Specker
theorem~\cite{Mermin1990Simple,peres1995quantum}:
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|@{\quad}c@{\quad}|@{\quad}c@{\quad}|@{\quad}c@{\quad}|}
\hline 
$\mathbb{1}\otimes\sigma_{z}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\mathbb{1}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$ \tabularnewline

\end{tabular}\,,
\par\end{center}
}
\noindent where
$\left\{\mathbb{1},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y},\sigma_{z}\right\}$ are Pauli
matrices acting on a pair of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ states.  The
observables in the Mermin-Peres square must have expectation
values~$\left\{ 1\right\} $ or $\left\{ -1\right\} $.  In each row and
column, the operators commute, and each operator is the product of two
others, except in the third column, where
$\left(\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}\right)\left(\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{x}\right)=-\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y}$.
Therefore, it is clearly impossible to find a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}$ such
that $\langle \mathbf{O}_{ij}\rangle_{\bar \mu}$ satisfies
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}).
 
We can in fact generalize the above theorem to state that for small
enough $\delta$, it is impossible to have $\delta$-deterministic
QIVPMs. Every QIVPM must map some events to truly uncertain intervals,
not just ``almost definite intervals.'' The significance of this
observation is that the uncertainty in the intervals is, in contrast
to the classical case, \emph{a fundamental part of quantum
  theory}. There are in fact two sources of uncertainty: one due to
the finite measurement resources and one due to complementarity, which
requires every quantum framework to be truly probabilistic.

\begin{thm}[Finite-precision Extension of Kochen-Specker] \label{cor:Kochen-Specker-IVPM} Given a Hilbert space $\Hilb$
  of dimension~$d\ge3$, there is no $\delta$-deterministic QIVPM for
  $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$.\end{thm}

The proof is by contradiction: suppose there is a
$\delta$-deterministic
QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, we claim that the
following
map~$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}:\events\rightarrow\left\{
  \imposs,\necess\right\} $ is a 0-deterministic QIVPM:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P\right)=\begin{cases}
\imposs\,, & \textrm{ if }\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]\:;\\
\necess\,, & \textrm{ if }\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[1-\delta,1\right]\:.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
However, since we know that 0-deterministic QIVPMs do not exist, the
map $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}$ cannot exist and hence $\bar{\mu}$ does
not exist.

It remains to verify that $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}$ is indeed a
0-deterministic QIVPM by checking that for orthogonal
operators~$P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$, we have that
$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}\right)=\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{1}\right)=\imposs$
implies
$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)=\imposs$. Indeed when
$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}\right)=\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{1}\right)=\imposs$,
we have both $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)$ and
$\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]$ which
implies
$\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)\subseteq\left[0,2\delta\right]$.
When $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$, i.e., $2\delta<1-\delta$, it follows that
$\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$ cannot be a subset of
$\left[1-\delta,1\right]$, but $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$ is
a subset of either $\left[0,\delta\right]$ or
$\left[1-\delta,1\right]$.  Hence, $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$
must be a subset of $\left[0,\delta\right]$, which implies
$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)=\imposs$. Thus the
theorem holds when $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$.

When $\delta \ge \frac{1}{3}$, the situation abruptly
changes. Assuming a Hilbert space $\Hilb$ of dimension $3$, then
for any projector $P$ that projects onto an $n$-dimensional subspace
of $\Hilb$, it is straightforward to check that
$\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[n/3,n/3\right]$ is a valid
$\frac{1}{3}$-deterministic QIVPM.

\section{Gleason}
\label{sec:Gleason}

In the classical setting, measurements done with limited resources and
poor precision may not uniquely identify the true state of a
system. However, there is always at least one state that is consistent
with the imprecise measurements.

\begin{thm}[Shapley~\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}]
  For a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, if a subspace
  of events~$\events'\subseteq\events$ commutes, then
  $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)\ne\emptyset$.
\end{thm}

In the idealized situation of real-valued quantum probability
measures, Gleason's theorem asserts that every measure is determined
by a unique state. 

\begin{thm}[Gleason~\cite{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum}]\label{cor:Gleason's}In
a Hilbert space $\Hilb$ of dimension $d\geq3$, given a quantum probability
measure~$\mu:\events\rightarrow[0,1]$, there exists a unique 
state~$\rho$ such that $\mu=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$.
\end{thm}

Thm.~\ref{thm:Shapley} is weaker: it asserts that, for each classical
subspace of events, a QIVPM must be consistent with \emph{some}
state. But the states consistent with different subspaces may be
incomparable, as the following example shows.

Given a three-dimensional Hilbert space $\Hilb$ with an orthonormal
basis $\left\{ \ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\right\} $, let
$\mathscr{I}_{1}=\left\{ \necess,\imposs,\unknown\right\} $,
$\ket{\ps}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{1}\right)/\sqrt{2}$,
$\ket{\ps'}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{2}\right)/\sqrt{2}$, and
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \begin{aligned}\imposs & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps'})\,,
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \begin{aligned}\necess & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps'})\,,
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \unknown=\bar{\mu}(P)\qquad\textrm{otherwise.}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
It is straightforward to verify that $\bar{\mu}$ is a QIVPM. Then we will
prove $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events\right)$ is an empty set by
contradiction. Suppose there is a
state\nb$\rho=\sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}\proj{\phi_{j}}\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events\right)$,
where $\sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}=1$ and $q_{j}>0$. Since $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(P)\in\bar{\mu}(P)$
for any\nb$P$, the state\nb$\rho$ must satisfy
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{0})=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{\ps})=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{\ps'})=0
\end{equation}
which implies $\ip{\phi_{j}}{0}=\ip{\phi_{j}}{\ps}=\ip{\phi_{j}}{\ps'}=0$
for all $j$. However, the last equation never holds. 
Thus, there is no state consistent with the QIVPM on all 
projectors\nb$P\in\events$, so Gleason's theorem does not hold for at least this
example.

Although Gleason's theorem does not hold for every QIVPM, we can show
that for a certain class of QIVPMs, the collection of states
consistent with the projectors get closer and closer to each other as
the intervals get narrower and narrower, eventually collapsing to a
single state when the intervals become infinitely precise real
numbers. To state this result, we introduce a few technical notions. 

We call a state $\rho$ a \emph{totally mixed state} if
$0<\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)<1$ for any
$P\in\events\backslash\left\{ \mathbb{0},\mathbb{1}\right\} $. We also
define a notion of distance based on the following norm of a
matrix~$A$ as
$\left\Vert A\right\Vert
=\max_{\ip{\psi}{\psi}=1}\left|\melem{\psi}{A}{\psi}\right|$~\citep{544199}. Now
consider the following collection of intervals:
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\mathscr{I}}_{n} & = & \set{\left[\frac{k-1}{2n},\frac{k+1}{2n}\right]\cap\left[0,1\right]}{k=0,\ldots,2n}\nonumber \\
 &  & \cup\left\{ \left[0,0\right],\left[1,1\right]\right\} 
\end{eqnarray}
which are overlapping intervals with length~$1/n$ except the intervals
at each end. 

A totally mixed state induces a QIVPM over the intervals above as
follows. We first define a map $\widehat{\iota}_{n}$ from the interval
$[0,1]$ to the collection of intervals as:
\begin{itemize}
\item when $x=0$ or $x=1$, $\widehat{\iota}_{n}\left(x\right)=\left[x,x\right]$;
\item when $0<x<1$, $\widehat{\iota}_{n}\left(x\right)=\left[\frac{k-1}{2n},\frac{k+1}{2n}\right]\cap\left[0,1\right]$,
where $k$ is defined by one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $k$ even and $k-0.5\le2nx\le k+0.5$;
\item $k$ odd and $k-0.5<2nx<k+0.5$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

It is now not difficult to verify that for any totally mixed
state~$\rho$ on a three-dimensional Hilbert space,
$\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ is a
QIVPM. Furthermore, we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\left\Vert \rho-\rho'\right\Vert \le1/\left(12n\right)$,
$\rho'\in\coreBorn\left(\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}},\events\right)$.
\item If $\rho'\in\coreBorn\left(\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}},\events\right)$,
then $\left\Vert \rho-\rho'\right\Vert \le1/n$.
\end{itemize}
In other words, for the states consistent with this QIVPM,
$\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ will become closer and
closer to $\rho'$ as $n$ goes to infinity. In the limiting case when
the intervals are infinitely precise, i.e.,
$\set{\left[x,x\right]}{x\in\left[0,1\right]}$, any QIVPM can be
recast as a real-valued one and will have a unique state consistent
with it on every projector when $d\ge3$.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
  
Foundational concepts in quantum mechanics, such as the Kochen-Specker
and Gleason theorems, rely in a very subtle way on the use of
unbounded resources. By assuming infinitely precise measurements,
these two insightful theorems underlie two fundamental aspects of
quantum mechanics. On the one hand, Kochen-Specker's result reveals a
distinctive aspect of physical reality, the fact that it is
contextual, and, on the other hand, Gleason's theorem establishes a
relationship between quantum states and probabilities uniquely defined
by Born's rule.  Our goal in this paper has been to analyze the
physical consequences of a mathematical framework that allows for
finite precision measurements by introducing the concept of quantum
interval-valued probability. This framework incorporates uncertainty
in the measurement results by defining fuzzy probability measures, and
includes standard quantum measurement as the particular instance of
sharp, infinitely precise, intervals.  In addition, we showed how
these two theorems emerge as limiting cases of this same framework,
thus connecting two seemingly unrelated aspects of quantum physics. We
noted that {\it arbitrary\/} finite precision measurement conditions
can nullify the main tenets of both theorems. However, by carefully
specifying experimental uncertainties, we were able to establish
rigorous bounds on the validity of these two theorems. Therefore, we
have established a context in which infinite precision quantum
mechanical theories can be reconciled with finite precision quantum
mechanical measurements, and have provided a possible resolution of
the Meyer-Mermin debate on the impact of finite precision on the
Kochen-Specker theorem~\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Mermin1999}.

The similar kind of subtleties happens when we want to define the
expectation value of a random variable. Consider an event $E$ such
that $\bar{\mu}(E)=[0.2,0.3]$ and $\bar{\mu}(\overline{E})=[0.7,0.8]$.
Given a random variable
\begin{equation}
X\left(\omega\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{, if }\omega\in E\textrm{ ;}\\
2 & \textrm{, if }\omega\notin E\textrm{ ,}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
its expectation value with respect to $\bar{\mu}$ might be naïvely
defined as\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & 1\cdot\bar{\mu}(E)+2\cdot\bar{\mu}(\overline{E})\\
 & = & 1\cdot[0.2,0.3]+2\cdot[0.7,0.8]\\
 & = & [1\cdot0.2+2\cdot0.7,1\cdot0.3+2\cdot0.8]\\
 & = & [1.6,1.9]\,.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}As we discussed in the previous paragraph, the
true probability of $\bar{\mu}(E)$, $\mu(E)$, can be anywhere in
the range $[0.2,0.3]$ and the true probability of $\bar{\mu}(\overline{E})$
is $\mu(\overline{E})=1-\mu(E)$. If $\mu(E)=0.2$, the expectation
value of $X$ with respect to $\mu$ is 
\begin{equation}
1\cdot\mu(E)+2\cdot\mu(\overline{E})=1\cdot0.2+2\cdot0.8=1.8\,;
\end{equation}
if $\mu(E)=0.3$, the expectation value of $X$ with respect to $\mu$
is
\begin{equation}
1\cdot\mu(E)+2\cdot\mu(\overline{E})=1\cdot0.3+2\cdot0.7=1.7\,.
\end{equation}
In another word, no matter how we pick $\mu(E)$, the expectation
value of $X$ is in $\left[1.7,1.8\right]$ which is a more realistic
expectation value of $X$ with respect to $\bar{\mu}$. The interval~$\left[1.7,1.8\right]$
is narrower than the naïve expectation value~$[1.6,1.9]$ because
the naïve one combines contradicting situations in the computation.
In general, the computation of the realistic expectation value, called
the Choquet integral, is more complex than what we discussed because
a random variable may have more than two values. Despite its complexity,
it is still a weight average among the values of a random variable
as given in the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Choquet integral~\citep{Vitali1925,Choquet1954,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}]\label{def:Choquet}Consider
a classical IVPM~$\bar{\mu}$ such that $\mul:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$
and $\mur:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$ are the left-end and
the right-end of $\bar{\mu}$, respectively, i.e., $\bar{\mu}\left(E\right)=\left[\mul\left(E\right),\mur\left(E\right)\right]$.
We decompose a random variable~$X$ into step functions, but we separate
the positive and negative terms and write like
\begin{equation}
X=\sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}x_{i}^{s}\mathbf{1}_{E_{i}^{s}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{1}_{E_{i}^{s}}$ is the indicator function of $E_{i}^{s}$,
and we order the value of its range from the smallest to the largest
\begin{equation}
x_{N^{-}}^{-}\le\ldots\le x_{1}^{-}\le0\le x_{1}^{+}\le\ldots\le x_{N^{+}}^{+}
\end{equation}
 and $\left\{ E_{i}^{-}\right\} _{i=1}^{N^{-}}$ and $\left\{ E_{i}^{+}\right\} _{i=1}^{N^{+}}$
are all disjoint. Let $E_{i}^{s\prime}=\bigcup_{j\ge i}E_{j}^{s}$
and $\Delta\mu^{*}\left(E_{i}^{s\prime}\right)=\mu^{*}\left(E_{i}^{s\prime}\right)-\mu^{*}\left(E_{i+1}^{s\prime}\right)$,
where $s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} $ and $\mu^{*}\in\left\{ \mul,\mur\right\} $.
Then, the Choquet integral of $X$ with respect to $\bar{\mu}$ is
\begin{equation}
\int X\rmd\bar{\mu}=\sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}x_{i}^{s}\left[\Delta\mul\left(E_{i}^{s\prime}\right),\Delta\mur\left(E_{i}^{s\prime}\right)\right]\,.\label{eq:interval-expectation}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Although Def.~\ref{def:Choquet} looks complex, it matches with our
intuition in the previous example. Let
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}\right)=\set{\pmeas:\events\rightarrow[0,1]}{\forall P\in\events.~\pmeas\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)}\,,\label{eq:core}
\end{equation}
be the set of possible ``true'' probability measure of an IVPM~$\bar{\mu}$.
Then, the following theorem claims the expectation value of $\bar{\mu}$
is the range of the expectation value of the probability measure in
the core of $\bar{\mu}$.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:Rosenmuller}\citep{Rosenmuller1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}~For
every classical IVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$ and
any random variable~$X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, 
\begin{equation}
\int X\rmd\bar{\mu}=\left[\min_{\mu\in\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}\right)}\int X\rmd\mu,\max_{\mu\in\mathrm{core}\left(\bar{\mu}\right)}\int X\rmd\mu\right]\,.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}

%   To proceed, we use a formulation of the
% ``Mermin-Peres square''~\cite{peres1995quantum,Mermin1990Simple}
% that uses the expectation value of a physical observable with respect
% to a QIVPM, where the interval-valued expectation value is consistent
% with the expectation value of the same observable in conventional
% quantum mechanics with infinite resources. We show that, as long as
% errors and uncertainties remain smaller than a particular value, the
% Kochen-Specker theorem remains valid. In other words, we established a

After we defined QIVPMs, we can easily define the expectation value
of an observable with respect to a QIVPM by adopting the idea of the
classical Choquet integral. Notice that the quantum expectation value~(\ref{eq:quantum-expectation})
is the weight average among the eigenvalues with the weight~$\mu(P_{i})$.
Similarly, given a classical random variable~$X=\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\mathbf{1}_{E_{i}}$,
the expectation value of $X$ with respect to a probability measure~$\mu$
is the weight average among $x_{i}$ with the weight~$\mu(E_{i})$.
Since the definition of Choquet integral is just using a more complex
but reasonable way to compute the weight, we can apply the same algorithm
on an observable and get the following definition.

\begin{definition}Consider a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}$ such that $\mul:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$
and $\mur:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$ are the left-end and
the right-end of $\bar{\mu}$, respectively, i.e., $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[\mul\left(P\right),\mur\left(P\right)\right]$
for all $P\in\events$. This time, when we express the observable
as its spectral decomposition
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{O}=\sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\lambda_{i}^{s}P_{i}^{s}\,,\label{eq:spectrum-decomposition}
\end{equation}
we separate the positive and negative eigenvalues and order its eigenvalues
from the smallest to the largest 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{N^{-}}^{-}\le\ldots\le\lambda_{1}^{-}\le0\le\lambda_{1}^{+}\le\ldots\le\lambda_{N^{+}}^{+}\,.
\end{equation}
Let $P_{i}^{s\prime}=\sum_{j\ge i}P_{j}^{s}$ and $\Delta\mu^{*}\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)=\mu^{*}\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)-\mu^{*}\left(P_{i+1}^{s\prime}\right)$,
where $s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} $ and $\mu^{*}\in\left\{ \mul,\mur\right\} $.
Then, the expectation value of $\mathbf{O}$ with respect to $\bar{\mu}$
is defined as
\begin{equation}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\lambda_{i}^{s}\left[\Delta\mul\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right),\Delta\mur\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)\right]\,.\label{eq:quantum-interval-expectation}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

If we define the multiplication of two singleton
sets~$\left\{ \lambda_{1}\right\} $ and $\left\{ \lambda_{2}\right\} $
to be $\left\{ \lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\right\} $.

We will now adapt the proof above to show that it is, in general,
impossible to have just the two intervals \imposs\ and \necess: every
QIVPM must be parameterized by a collection of intervals that includes
at least one additional ``fuzzy'' interval and some events must be
associated with such uncertain intervals. The significance of this
observation is that the uncertainty in the intervals is, in contrast
to the classical case, \emph{a fundamental part of quantum
  theory}. There are in fact two sources of uncertainty: one due to
the finite measurement resources and one due to complementarity, which
requires every quantum framework to be truly probabilistic.

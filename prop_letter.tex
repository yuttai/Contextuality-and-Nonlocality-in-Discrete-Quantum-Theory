\section{Introduction}

In this letter, we extend our previous work on the foundations of
computability in quantum mechanics by exploring the application of
interval-valued probability measures (IVPM) to achieving a coherent
formulation of finite-resource quantum mechanics.

There are long-standing debates in the foundations of quantum
mechanics regarding the tension between finite precision measurement
and contextuality\nb\cite{BarrettKent2004,Appleby_2005}.  For example,
Meyer\nb\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751} and Mermin\nb\cite{Mermin1999} disagree
on whether finite-precision measurements invalidate the Kochen-Specker
theorem\nb\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum}, and discussion
continues on whether contextuality is experimentally
verifiable\nb\cite{Spekkens2005,GuehneKleinmannCabelloEtAl2010,MazurekPuseyKunjwalEtAl2016}. The
fundamental question is how to make mathematical theories of quantum
mechanics that are intrinsically, rather than only implicitly,
consistent with the resources available for the realistic accuracy of
an actual measurement.

Our first observation is that essential objectives of our program to
achieve a computable theory of quantum mechanics and finite-resource
measurement, attempted previously with computable number
systems\nb\cite{usat,geometry2013apsrev4,DQT2014}, may be achievable by
extending classical interval-valued probability
measures\nb\cite{JamisonLodwick2004} to the quantum domain.  We begin by
axiomatizing a quantum interval-valued probability measure (QIVPM)
framework exploiting the fact that a density matrix approach can be
considered as equivalent to a description of quantum states using
probability measures\nb\cite{10.2307/2308516,Varadarajan2008}. %Mackey=10.2307
One result is that the expectation value of an observable with respect
to a QIVPM can be defined to be consistent with the constraints on the
expectation value of the same observable expected from continuous
quantum mechanics.  We then examine Gleason's
theorem\nb\cite{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum} and the
Kochen-Specker theorem in the context of QIVPM's, and conclude that
they correspond to the limit of an infinite number of precise
intervals, and the set of cryptodeterministic intervals (the set\nb$\{\imposs,\necess\}$),
respectively.

We note, however, that in this approach there exist QIVPM's that do
not correspond to a density matrix computable by the Born rule, so
that Gleason's theorem cannot hold in general.  It thus remains
possible that a refinement of the basic definition of a quantum state
or the computation of probability from a state may be required when we
rigorously consider the implications of finite precision measurement.

A question we want to entertain in this paper is \ldots
Can one incorporate in a rigorous mathematical framework the idea of
finite precision measurement? Yes QIVPM. Now what is the fate of the 
foundational theorems of QM when this framework is applied?


% Textbook quantum mechanics asserts that the probability of a
% measurement can be computed from wave function of the system and the
% measuring observable \emph{exactly} while real measurements must be
% finite precision.  Whether finite precision measurement in reality
% affect the idealized quantum concept, e.g.,
% contextuality\nb\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Mermin1999,BarrettKent2004},
% and the very foundation of quantum mechanics is still a problem. In
% this letter, we model the finite precision quantum measurement by
% quantum interval-valued probability measures (IVPMs) which provides
% not only a uniform framework to understand Gleason's
% theorem\nb\cite{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum} and the
% Kochen-Specker
% theorem\nb\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum,Redhead1987-REDINA,Griffiths2003}
% but also some examples which cannot be explained by the Born
% rule\nb\cite{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}.

% The tension between finite precision measurement and the foundation of
% quantum mechanics sharpened, when the original definition of
% contextuality based on infinitely precise numbers is proved not
% experimental verifiable\nb\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Kent1999}.  After a
% long debate\nb\cite{Mermin1999,Peres2003,BarrettKent2004}, people are
% still trying to update the definition of contextuality when they want
% to perform further
% experiments\nb\cite{Spekkens2005,GuehneKleinmannCabelloEtAl2010,MazurekPuseyKunjwalEtAl2016}.

% We found that finite precision measurement affects not only
% contextuality but also the fundamental rule computing probability from
% a state.  In the early formulation of quantum mechanics, von Neumann
% essentially formulated a quantum state as a density matrix while
% Mackey formulated a quantum state as a quantum probability measure
% which are proved by Gleason to be the essentially same as a density
% matrix\nb\cite{Varadarajan2008}.  Combining quantum probability measures
% and the classical IVPM\nb\cite{JamisonLodwick2004} which could be used
% to formulate classical finite precision measurement, we can define
% quantum IVPMs. Surprisingly, there is a quantum IVPM which cannot be
% compatible with any density matrix according to the Born rule. Similar
% to revising the definition of contextuality because of finite
% precision measurement, the very basic definition of a quantum state or
% how to compute the probability from a state might need to be refined
% when we consider the finite precision measurement. This can also
% provide a new quantum phenomena different from the classical world,
% because IVPMs become classical so that the non-Born IVPMs disappears
% when we restricting the domain of quantum IVPMs on a commuting
% sub-event space.

\section{Fuzzy Measurements}
 
A \emph{probability space} is a mathematical abstraction specifying
the necessary conditions for reasoning coherently about collections of
uncertain events\nb\cite{Kolmogorov1950}. In the quantum case, the
events of interest are specified by \emph{projection operators}
$P$. These include the empty projection\nb$\mathbb{0}$, the identity
projection\nb$\mathbb{1}$, projections of the form $\proj{\psi}$ where
$\ket{\psi}$ is a pure quantum state (an element of a Hilbert space),
sums of \emph{orthogonal} projections $P_0$ and $P_1$ such
$P_0P_1=\mathbb{0}$, and products of \emph{commuting} projections
$P_0$ and $P_1$ such $P_0P_1=P_1P_0$. In a well-defined quantum
probability
space\nb\cite{10.2307/2308516,gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,Maassen2010},
each event $P_{i}$ is mapped using a probability measure
$\mu : P \rightarrow [0,1]$ to a probability $\mu(P_{i})$ subject to
the following constraints: $\mu(\mathbb{0})=0$, $\mu(\mathbb{1})=1$,
$\mu\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=1-\mu\left(P\right)$, and for each pair
of \emph{orthogonal} projections $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$, we have:
\begin{equation}
{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)={\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\textrm{.}\label{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}
\end{equation}

As an example, consider a three-dimensional Hilbert space with
orthonormal basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\}$ and an observable
$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral decomposition
$\proj{0} + 2\,\proj{1} + 3\,\proj{2}$. Two fragments of valid
probability measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ that can associated with this
space are: $\mu_1(\proj{0}) = 0.5$, $\mu_1(\proj{1}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_1(\proj{2}) = 0$, and $\mu_2(\proj{0}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_2(\proj{1}) = 0$, $\mu_2(\proj{2}) = 0.5$. By the Born rule, the
first probability measure corresponds to the quantum system being in a
state $(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}$ and the second corresponds to
the quantum system being in the state
$(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{2})/\sqrt{2}$, where in both cases
$|\alpha|=1$. The expectation value of the observable in the first
case is 1.5 and in the second it is 2.

The above axioms describe a mathematical idealization involving
infinitely precise measurements. In an actual experimental setup with
an ensemble of quantum states that are not exactly identical, and with
small imperfections and inaccuracies in measuring devices, an
experimenter might only be able to determine that the probability of
the event $\proj{0}$ is in the range $[0.49,0.51]$ instead of
precisely 0.5. The spread in this range depends on the amount of
resources (time, energy, money, etc) that are devoted to the
experiment. In the classical setting, this ``fuzziness'' is formalized
by moving to \emph{interval-valued probability measures}.

% In conventional quantum theory (CQT), when we measure a property
% $\mathbf{O}$ of a physical system whose state is represented by a
% density matrix\nb$\rho$, the probability to obtain the value $\lambda$
% of that property is determined by the Born rule
% $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P_{i}\right)=\Tr\left(\rho
%   P_{i}\right)$, where $P_{i}$ denotes the projector onto the
% eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_{i}$ of the
% Hermitian operator
% $\mathbf{O}$\nb\cite{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}.
% Alternatively, one may say that the state $\rho$ determines the
% probability measure $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ defined as a function
% from the set $\events$ of all possible projectors $P$ onto the
% interval $[0,1]$, and satisfies the following probability axioms\nb
% \cite{10.2307/2308516,gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,Maassen2010}:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\mathbb{0})=0$. 
% \item $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\mathbb{1})=1$. 
% \item $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=
% 1-\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)$. 
% \item For a set of mutually orthogonal projectors $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$,
% $P_iP_j=\delta_{ij}P_i$,
% we have 
% \begin{equation}
% \mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i}\right)=
% \sum_{i=1}^{N}\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P_{i}\right)
% \textrm{ .}\label{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}
% \end{equation}
% \end{itemize}
% Conversely, given any quantum probability measure\nb$\mu:\events\rightarrow[0,1]$
% satisfying the above axioms, Gleason's theorem asserts that there
% exists a unique state\nb$\rho$ such that $\mu=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$
% in a Hilbert space of dimension $d\geq3$\nb\cite{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum}.

% Furthermore, if we express an observable\nb$\mathbf{O}$ as its spectrum
% decomposition\nb$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}P_{i}$, the expectation
% value of $\mathbf{O}$ is given by\nb\cite{peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}
% \begin{equation}
% \expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho}=\Tr\left(\rho\mathbf{O}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P_{i}\right)\ .\label{eq:quantum-expectation}
% \end{equation}

% To formalize the idea of finite precision measurement, we next
% introduce the notion of quantum interval-valued probability measures
% (\emph{IVPMs})\nb$\bar{\mu}$. The latter replaces the infinitely precise
% interval $[0,1]$ by a finite collection $\mathscr{I}$ of
% intervals. Since the intervals $\imposs=\left[0,0\right]$ and
% $\necess=\left[1,1\right]$ should be included in $\mathscr{I}$, and
% arithmetic operations on intervals
% satisfy \begin{subequations}\label{eq:interval-operations}
% \begin{eqnarray}
%  &  & [l_{1},r_{1}]+[l_{2},r_{2}]=[l_{1}+l_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]\textrm{ and}\\
%  &  & x[l,r]=\begin{cases}
% [xl,xr] & \textrm{for }x\ge0\textrm{ ;}\\{}
% [xr,xl] & \textrm{for }x\le0\textrm{ .}
% \end{cases}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \end{subequations} $\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$ is
% defined by the axioms: 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\left[0,0\right]$. 
% \item $\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]$. 
% \item $\bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=\left[1,1\right]-\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)$. 
% \item For a set of mutually orthogonal projections $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$,
% $P_{i}P_{j}=\delta_{ij}P_{i}$, we have 
% \begin{equation}
% \bar{\mu}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i}\right)\subseteq\sum_{i=1}^{N}\bar{\mu}\left(P_{i}\right)\label{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}
% \end{equation}
% \end{itemize}
% condition that provides only a bound and not an equivalence as in
% Eq.~\eqref{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}. For example, if we consider
% $\left\{ P_{1},P_{2}\right\} =\left\{ P,\mathbb{1}-P\right\} $ and
% $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[l,r\right]$, we have, when $r-l=\ell>0$,
% \[
% \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]\subsetneq\left[1-\ell,1+\ell\right]=\bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P\right).

\section{Intervals of Uncertainty}
  
We will start by reviewing IVPMs in the classical setting\nb\cite{JamisonLodwick2004}
and then propose our quantum generalization. In the classical setting,
there are several proposals for ``imprecise probabilities\nb\cite{Dempster1967,Artstein1972,Shafer1976,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Weichselberger2000,JamisonLodwick2004,Grabisch2016}.''
Although these proposals differ in some details, they all share the
fact that the probability $\mu(E)$ of an event $E$ is generalized
from a single real number to an interval of certainty $[\ell,r]$
where\nb$\ell$ intuitively corresponds to the strength of evidence
for the event and $r$ corresponds to the strength of evidence against
the event. The collection of intervals used in the definition of a
probability measure must satisfy certain properties which we explain
next.

First for each interval $[\ell,r]$ we have the natural constraint
$0 \leq \ell \leq r \leq 1$ that guarantees that every element of the
interval can be interpreted as a conventional probability. We also
include $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ as limiting intervals to
refer to the probability of impossible events (e.g., the null event)
and certain events (e.g., the event covering the entire sample space).
For each interval $[\ell,r]$, we also need the interval
$[1-r,1-\ell]$ so that if one interval refers to the probability of an
event, the other refers to the probability of the complement
event. For example, if we discover as a result of an experiment that
$\mu(E) = [0.2,0.3]$ for some event\nb$E$, we may conclude that
$\mu(\overline{E}) = [0.7,0.8]$ for the complement event
$\overline{E}$. In addition to these simple conditions, there are some
subtle conditions on how intervals are combined, which we discuss
next.

Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be to disjoint events with probabilities
$\mu(E_1)=[\ell_1,r_1]$ and $\mu(E_2)=[\ell_2,r_2]$. A first attempt
at calculating the probability of the combined event that either $E_1$
or $E_2$ occurs might be $\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$. In
some cases, this is indeed a sensible definition. For example, if
$\mu(E_1)=[0.1,0.2]$ and $\mu(E_2)=[0.3,0.4]$ we get
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [0.4,0.6]$. But consider an event $E$ such that
$\mu(E)=[0.2,0.3]$ and hence $\mu(\overline{E})=[0.7,0.8]$. The two
events $E$ and $\overline{E}$ are disjoint; the previous naïve way
of combining the intervals would give $\mu(E\cup\overline{E})=[0.9,1.1]$
which is not a valid probability interval. Moreover the event
$E\cup\overline{E}$ is the identity event covering the entire space; its
probability interval should be $[1,1]$ which is sharper than
$[0.9,1.1]$. The problem is that the two intervals are correlated:
there is more information in the combined event than in each event
separately. In our example, even though the true probability of
$\mu(E)$ can be in anywhere in the range $[0.2,0.3]$ and the true
probability of $\mu(\overline{E})$ can be in anywhere in the range
$[0.7,0.8]$, the values are not independent. Any value of
$\mu(E) \leq 0.25$ will force $\mu(\overline{E})\geq 0.75$. To account
for such subtleties, the axioms of interval-valued probability do not
use a strict equality for the combination of disjoint events. The
correct constraint regarding the probability of $E_1\cup E_2$ when $E_1$
and $E_2$ are disjoint is
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) \subseteq [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$ which, in combination
with the requirement for the identity event would force
$\mu(E\cup\overline{E})$ to always be $[1,1]$ irrespective of the
particular assignments of $\mu(E)$ or $\mu(\overline{E})$. 

When combining non-disjoint events, there is a further subtlety whose
resolution will give the most general and final condition as
follows. For general, non-necessarily disjoint events $E_1$ and $E_2$,
we have:
\begin{equation}
\mu(E_1\cup E_2) + \mu(E_1\cap E_2) \subseteq \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2)
\label{eq:classicalconvex}
\end{equation}
which is a generalization of the classical inclusion-exclusion
principle that uses $\subseteq$ instead of $=$ for the same reason as
before. The new condition, known as
\emph{convexity}\nb\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Grabisch2016},
reduces to the previously
motivated condition when the events are disjoint, i.e., when
$\mu(E_1\cap E_2) = 0$.

We now have the necessary ingredients to define QIVPMs as a
generalization of both classical IVPMs and conventional quantum
probability measures. More precisely the quantum IVPM will reduce to
the classical IVPM when the space of quantum events is restricted to
mutually commuting sub-events.

\begin{definition}[QIVPM]
  Given a collection of intervals $\mathscr{I}$ including
  $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ and with addition and scalar
  multiplication defined as follows:
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:interval-operations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
   &  & [\ell_{1},r_{1}]+[\ell_{2},r_{2}]=[\ell_{1}+\ell_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]\textrm{ and}\\
   &  & x[\ell,r]=\begin{cases}
  [x\ell,xr] & \textrm{for }x\ge0\textrm{ ;}\\{}
  [xr,x\ell] & \textrm{for }x\le0\textrm{ ,}
  \end{cases}
  \end{eqnarray}
  \end{subequations}
  a QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$ is an assignment of intervals to each event
  (projection operator) subject to the following constraints:
  $\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\left[0,0\right]$,
  $\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]$,
  $\bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=\left[1,1\right]-\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)$,
  and for each pair of \emph{commuting} projections $P_0$ and $P_1$,
  we have:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)
\label{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
The first three constraints are the direct counterpart of the
corresponding ones for conventional probability measures. With the
understanding that the union of classical sets $E_1\cup E_2$ is replaced
by $P_0+P_1-P_0P_1$ in the case of projection operators\nb\cite{Griffiths2003}, the last
condition, Eq.~\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}, is
a direct counterpart of Eq.~\ref{eq:classicalconvex}.

Contrary to the case with conventional quantum probability spaces,
there is generally no unique state consistent with a QIVPM. Given
observations done with finite resources, the probabilities become
intervals, and we say a state\nb$\rho$ is consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on
a projector\nb$P$ if
$\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)$, and
denoted by
$\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\left\{ P\right\} \right)$,
where $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)=\Tr\left(\rho P\right)$
is the probability that the event\nb$P$ happens determined by the
Born rule\nb\cite{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}.
Moreover, $\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S\right)$ means $\rho$ is
consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on every projector in $S$.

Quantum IVPMs become classical IVPMs when the space of events includes
only mutually commuting events, where $\events'\subseteq\events$
is called a sub-event space if it satisfies the following conditions.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\left\{ \mathbb{0},\mathbb{1}\right\} \subseteq\events'$.
\item For any projection\nb$P\in\events'$, we have $\mathbb{1}-P\in\events'$. 
\item For each pair of orthogonal projections\nb$P_0 \in \events'$ and
  $P_1 \in \events'$, we have $(P_0 + P_1) \in \events'$. 
\end{itemize}

For example, assuming the three intervals \imposs, \necess, and
$\unknown=\left[0,1\right]$, then:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}_{1}\left(P\right)=\begin{cases}
\necess & \text{, if }P=\mathbb{1}\text{ ;}\\
\imposs & \text{, if }P=\mathbb{0}\text{ ;}\\
\unknown & \text{, otherwise,}
\end{cases}\label{eq:no-information-IVPM}
\end{equation}
is a quantum IVPM. This measure represents the beliefs of an
experimenter with no prior knowledge about the particular quantum
system in question; any quantum state would be consistent with
$\bar{\mu}_{1}$ on any projectors. We have that
$\events_{0}=\left\{ \mathbb{0},\proj{0},\proj{1},\mathbb{1}\right\} $
is a commuting sub-event space. Restricting $\bar{\mu}_{1}$ on
$\events_{0}$, $\bar{\mu}_{1}|_{\events_{0}}$, gives a classical
IVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}_{2}$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{0}) & =\imposs & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{0}) & =\unknown\\
\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{1}) & =\necess & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{1}) & =\unknown
\end{aligned}
\textrm{ .}
\end{equation}
If we identify the density matrices\nb$\proj{0}$ and $\proj{1}$ as
the head and the tail of a coin, respectively, then $\bar{\mu}_{2}$
represents that an experimenter knows nothing about a coin before
she tosses it. Moreover, for each $p\in\left[0,1\right]$, the mixed
state\nb$p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$ represents a classical
coin with probability\nb$p$ to get head, and $p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$
is consistent with $\bar{\mu}_{2}$ on $\events_{0}$ because any
classical coin should be consistent with the situation where an experimenter
has no prior knowledge.

\section{Kochen-Specker} 
  
Our first result regarding QIVPM is that a QIVPM cannot be
cryptodeterministic in the sense of Peres\nb\cite{PeresRon1988,peres1995quantum}. We
will adapt the proof of the Kochen-Specker
theorem\nb\cite{kochenspecker1967,
  peres1995quantum,Redhead1987-REDINA,Griffiths2003} to show that it
is, in general, impossible to just have the two intervals \imposs\ and
\necess: every QIVPM must be parameterized by a collection of
intervals that includes at least one additional ``fuzzy'' interval and
some events must be associated with such uncertain intervals. The
significance of this observation is that the uncertainty in the
intervals is, in contrast to the classical case, \emph{a fundamental
  part of quantum theory}. There are in fact two sources of
uncertainty: one due to the finite measurement resources and one due
to complementarity which requires every quantum framework to be truly
probabilistic.

We will proceed by assuming a cryptodeterministic QIVMP $\bar{\mu}$
and derive a contradiction using the following nine ``Mermin-Peres square''
observables\nb\cite{Mermin1990Simple,peres1995quantum}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
$\mathbb{1}\otimes\sigma_{z}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\mathbb{1}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
$\sigma_{x}\otimes\mathbb{1}$  & $\mathbb{1}\otimes\sigma_{x}$  & $\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{x}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
$\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{z}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{x}$  & $\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

The argument refers to the expectation value of these
observables. In the case of QIVPM this is defined as follows. 

\begin{definition}Given a Hilbert space of $d\ge3$, for every QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$,
any observable\nb$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral decomposition $\mathbf{O}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}P_{i}$,
and $\events'$ is minimal sub-event space containing $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$,
we have
\begin{equation}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\left[\min_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho},\max_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho}\right]\textrm{ .}\label{eq:quantum-interval-expectation-core}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

The expectation value is intuitively between two possible outcomes
which lie between the minimum and maximum bounds of the given
probability intervals, and this definition also consistent with the classical
Choquet integral on commuting sub-event space by adopting the classical
results\nb\cite{Rosenmuller1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}.
If the QIVPM is cryptodeterministic, this
interval collapses to a singleton $\left\{ \lambda\right\} $, where
$\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{O}$. If we define the
multiplication of two singleton sets\nb$\left\{ \lambda_{1}\right\} $
and $\left\{ \lambda_{2}\right\} $ to be
$\left\{ \lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\right\} $, then we have
\begin{equation}
\prod_{j=1}^{N}\expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\expval{\prod_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}\label{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}
\end{equation}
for any sequence of commuting observables\nb$\left\{ \mathbf{O}_{j}\right\} _{j=1}^{N}$.

Since the expectation value\nb$\expval{\cdot}_{\bar{\mu}}$ satisfying
these two properties, the observables in the Mermin-Peres square must
have the the expectation value\nb$\left\{ 1\right\} $ or $\left\{ -1\right\} $.
In each row and column, operators commutes, and each operator is the
product of the two others, except in the third column $\left(\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}\right)\left(\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{x}\right)=-\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y}$.
Therefore, it is clear impossible to find a IVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}$ such
that 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\langle\mathbb{1} & \otimes\sigma_{z}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{z} & \otimes\mathbb{1}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{z} & \otimes\sigma_{z}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}}\\
\langle\sigma_{x} & \otimes\mathbb{1}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\mathbb{1} & \otimes\sigma_{x}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{x} & \otimes\sigma_{x}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}}\\
\langle\sigma_{x} & \otimes\sigma_{z}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{z} & \otimes\sigma_{x}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}} & \langle\sigma_{y} & \otimes\sigma_{y}\rangle_{\bar{\mu}}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:MerminSquare-values}
\end{equation}
satisfying Eq.~(\ref{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}).

\section{Gleason}

In the classical setting, measurements done with limited resources and
poor precision may not uniquely identify the true state of a system
system. However, there is always at least one state that is consistent
with the imprecise
measurements\nb\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:Shapley}
  For every QIVPM\nb$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, if a
  sub-event space\nb$\events'\subseteq\events$ commutes, then
  $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)\ne\emptyset$.
\end{thm}

Gleason's theorem asserts any quantum real-valued probability measure
is consistent with a unique mixed state, and Shapley proved a quantum
IVPM must approximate some states for each classical sub-event
space. However, it may not approximate the same state in every
sub-event space. As the result, there may be no state consistent with
a quantum IVPM on all projectors\nb$\events$.

\begin{example}\label{ex:three-dimensional-three-value}
  Given a three dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis
  $\left\{ \ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\right\} $.  Let
  $\mathscr{I}_{1}=\left\{ \necess,\imposs,\unknown\right\} $,
  $\ket{\ps}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{1}\right)/\sqrt{2}$,
  $\ket{\ps'}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{2}\right)/\sqrt{2}$, and
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \begin{aligned}\imposs & =\bar{\mu}_{3}(\mathbb{0})=\bar{\mu}_{3}(\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}_{3}(\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}_{3}(\proj{\ps'})\textrm{ ,}
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \begin{aligned}\necess & =\bar{\mu}_{3}(\mathbb{1})=\bar{\mu}_{3}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}_{3}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}_{3}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps'})\textrm{ ,}
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \unknown=\bar{\mu}_{3}(P)\qquad\textrm{otherwise.}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
It is straightforward to verify that $\bar{\mu}_{3}$ is a
quantum IVPM. 

Let $S_{1}=\left\{ \proj{0},\proj{\ps}\right\} $. Because
$\bar{\mu}_{3}(\proj{0})=\bar{\mu}_{3}(\proj{\ps})=\imposs$, we have
$\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{0})=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{\ps})=0$
for any mixed
state\nb$\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{3},S_{1}\right)$.  Hence,
$\rho$ cannot be any state other than $\ket{2}$, the only pure state orthogonal to both
$\ket{0}$ and $\ket{\ps}$, and it is easy to verify $\proj{2}$ is actually
in $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{3},S_{1}\right)$.

Similarly, let $S_{2}=\left\{ \proj{0},\proj{\ps'}\right\} $. We have
$\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{3},S_{2}\right)=\left\{ \proj{1}\right\} $.
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{3},\events\right)\subseteq\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{3},S_{1}\right)\cap\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{3},S_{2}\right)=\emptyset
\end{equation}
and must be empty.
\end{example}

Although Gleason's theorem doesn't hold for every quantum IVPM, it
can be applied in a limit case when the intervals are infinitely precise.
That is, when $\mathscr{I}_{\infty}=\set{\left[x,x\right]}{x\in\left[0,1\right]}$,
any quantum IVPM can be recast as an real-valued one and has a unique
state consistent with it on every projector when $d\ge3$. 

In general, this kind of inconsistency can be reduced if we increase
the measurement resource, that is, using finer intervals. We conjecture
by using finer and finer intervals, it would be more and more likely
that there is a state consistent with a quantum IVPM on all projectors\nb$\events$.

\section{Conclusion}

Foundational concepts in quantum mechanics, such as Gleason and
Kochen-Specker theorems, rely in a very subtle way on the use of
unbounded resources. By assuming infinitely precise measurements,
these two insightful theorems underline two fundamental aspects of
quantum mechanics. On the one hand, Gleason's result establishes a
relationship between quantum states and probabilities uniquely defined
by Born's rule, on the other, Kochen-Specker unveils a distinctive
aspect of physical reality, the fact that it is contextual.  Our goal
in this paper has been to analyze the physical consequences of a
mathematical framework that allows for finite precision measurements
by introducing the concept of quantum interval-valued probability. The
latter incorporates uncertainty in the measurement results by defining
fuzzy probability measures, and includes standard quantum measurement
as the particular instance of sharp, infinitely precise, intervals.
In addition, we showed how these two theorems emerge as limiting cases
of this very same framework, thus connecting two seemingly unrelated
aspects of quantum physics. Most importantly, we concluded that
arbitrary finite precision measurement conditions nullify the main
tenets of both theorems.

\bibliography{prop}
\end{document}


To adapt the axioms of such IVPMs to the quantum case, we proceed as
follows. First we fix a collection of intervals $\mathscr{I}$ that
represents an abstraction of the available experimental resources. At
one extreme, infinitely precise resources would correspond to the
collection of intervals $\{[x,x] \mid x \in [0,1]\}$. This case should
coincide with the idealized situation above. At another extreme, an
experiment with ``minimal'' resources would correspond to the
following three intervals $\imposs=\left[0,0\right]$,
$\necess=\left[1,1\right]$, and $\unknown=[0,1]$. As before, the first
two intervals are associated with the empty projection and the
identity projection but every other projection would be associated
with $\unknown$; its probability can be anything in the range
$[0,1]$. A third special situation would be to consider IVPMs with
only the two intervals $\imposs=\left[0,0\right]$ and
$\necess=\left[1,1\right]$. This is what Peres calls the
\emph{cryptodeterministic} case in which there is no ambiguity about
the status of any event; we know for certain if it will occur or not.

\begin{definition}
$\bar{\mu}$ is called convex. if for all
commuting $P_{0},P_{1}\in\events$, we have
$\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)$.
\end{definition}

Consider again
Eq.~\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}. We will
generalize it as follows for all commuting $P_{0},P_{1}\in\events$, we
have
$\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)$. Note
that if $P_0$ and $P_1$ are \emph{orthogonal}, i.e., if $P_0P_1=0$ the
new equation reduces to
Eq.~\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}.

\begin{verbatim}
Inclusion exclusion principle 
 pr(e1 union e2) + pr (e1 intersect e2) = 
  pr(e1) + pr(e2)

in classical Real number prob. LHS = X; RHS = X

---

in classical IVPM; we only get LHS <= X; RHS <= X
but we have no connection between LHS and RHS

convexity imposes that LHS >= RHS

---

our condition in the quantum case is the same; 
our left(LHS) is >= left(RHS); the right is dual, 
which makes LHS interval subset RHS interval.

--

replace set union by projection sum = p0 + p1 - p0p1
replace = by subseteq

and we get convexity definition

-- 

Now we need a simple classical example that shows 
why we need convexity or at least what it means

must be dimension 4 because everything of dim 3 
is convex in classical case

Consider omega = { 0, 1, 2, 3 }
intervals = imposssible, certain, 
            unlikely = [0,0.5], likely [0.5,1] 

mu(empty) = imposs
mu(omega) = certain
mu({j}) = unlikely
mu(Omega \ {j}) = likely
mu({0,1}) = mu({0,2}) = mu({1,2}) = unlikely
mu({0,3}) = mu({1,3}) = mu({2,3}) = likely

EQ A:
mu({0}) + mu({0,1,2}) = [0.5,1.5]
mu({0,1}) + mu({0,2}) = [0,1]

AND [0.5,1.5] is not subseteq of [0,1]

Note that there is a core p(0) = p(1) = p(2) = 0.2, 
p(3) = 0.4, and under that core both sides of EQ A 
have prob. 0.8. So one way to make it convex is 
to use very precise intervals [0.2,0.2] etc. 

Another way to make this convex is by choosing 
just one additional interval unknown [0,1] 
instead of unlikely and likely.

Intuition: the more you group the more 
precise you get

\end{verbatim}

In the classical setting, IVPMs typically are equipped with additional
conditions to ensure they are ``well-behaved.''

Yu-Tsung: please construct an example with commuting events P0 and P1 such that:

mu(P0 + P1 - P0P1) + mu(P0P1) = [x,y]

and $[x,y]$ is NOT included in $[z,w]$

Then, $\bar{\mu}_{0}:\events'\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$ defined by\begin{subequations}

= & \bar{\mu}_{0}(\proj{0}+\proj{1})+\bar{\mu}_{0}(\proj{0}+\proj{2})\textrm{ .}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
}

Formally, we can ask: what can we deduce about the state of a quantum
system given a quantum IVPM, i.e., given observations done with finite
resources. Since the probabilities are now intervals, it is intuitive
to say a state\nb$\rho$ is consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on a projector\nb$P$
if $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)$,
and denoted by $\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\left\{ P\right\} \right)$.
Moreover, $\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S\right)$ means $\rho$
is consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on every projector in $S$.

Consider a quantum IVPM $\bar{\mu}$ such that $\mul:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$
and $\mur:\events\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$ are the left-end and
the right-end of $\bar{\mu}$, respectively, i.e., $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[\mul\left(P\right),\mur\left(P\right)\right]$
for all $P\in\events$. This time, when we express an observable as
its spectral decomposition
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{O}=\sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\lambda_{i}^{s}P_{i}^{s}\textrm{ ,}\label{eq:spectrum-decomposition}
\end{equation}
we separate the positive and negative eigenvalues and order its eigenvalues
from the smallest to the largest 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{N^{-}}^{-}\le\ldots\le\lambda_{1}^{-}\le0\le\lambda_{1}^{+}\le\ldots\le\lambda_{N^{+}}^{+}\textrm{ .}
\end{equation}
Let $P_{i}^{s\prime}=\sum_{j\ge i}P_{j}^{s}$ and $\Delta\mu^{*}\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)=\mu^{*}\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)-\mu^{*}\left(P_{i+1}^{s\prime}\right)$,
where $s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} $ and $\mu^{*}\in\left\{ \mul,\mur\right\} $.
We can combine the classical Choquet integral\nb\cite{Vitali1925,Choquet1954,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}
with Eq.~(\ref{eq:quantum-expectation}) and define the expectation
value of $\mathbf{O}$ with respect to $\bar{\mu}$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}} & = & \sum_{s\in\left\{ +,-\right\} }\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\lambda_{i}^{s}\left[\Delta\mul\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right),\Delta\mur\left(P_{i}^{s\prime}\right)\right]\textrm{ .}\label{eq:quantum-interval-expectation}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{table*}
\caption{\label{table:quantum-interval-expectation}This table highlights the
process to compute $\expval{\mathbf{O}_{1}}_{\bar{\mu}_{1}}$. Notice
that $\bar{\mu}_{1}$ is defined by Eq.~(\ref{eq:no-information-IVPM}),
$\mul_{1}$ and $\mur_{1}$ are defined by $\left[\mul_{1}\left(P\right),\mur_{1}\left(P\right)\right]=\bar{\mu}_{1}\left(P\right)$,
and $P_{3}^{+\prime}=\sum_{j\ge3}P_{j}^{s}=\mathbb{0}$ so that $\mul_{1}\left(P_{3}^{+\prime}\right)=\mur_{1}\left(P_{3}^{+\prime}\right)=0$.}

\end{table*}
For example, given a three dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal
basis $\left\{ \ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\right\} $. Let $J_{\mathrm{z}}=\proj{0}-\proj{2}$,
and $\mathbf{O}_{1}=2\mathbb{1}-J_{\mathrm{z}}^{2}=2\proj{1}+\proj{0}+\proj{2}$.
By following Table~\ref{table:quantum-interval-expectation}, we
have 
\begin{equation}
\expval{\mathbf{O}_{1}}_{\bar{\mu}_{1}}=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\lambda_{i}^{+}\left[\Delta\mul\left(P_{i}^{+\prime}\right),\Delta\mur\left(P_{i}^{+\prime}\right)\right]=\left[1,2\right]\textrm{ .}
\end{equation}
The expectation value is intuitively between two possible outcomes,
$1$ and $2$, even if we have no prior knowledge about the likelihood
of outcomes. In contrast, if we naively multiply eigenvalues with
intervals, their sum, $\sum_{i=1}^{2}\lambda_{i}^{+}\bar{\mu}_{1}\left(P_{i}^{+}\right)=\left[0,3\right]$,
is a worse and counter-intuitive estimation. In fact, estimating the
lower-bound by $1\cdot0+2\cdot0=0$ is too pessimistic because we
know one of outcomes must happen without any prior knowledge.

Intuitively, the expectation value of an observable with respect to a
QIVPM is bounded by the minimum and maximum expectation value of the
same observable with respect to states consistent with it. This is
true when we require our IVPM to be convex, and on a commuting
sub-event space induced by an observable.

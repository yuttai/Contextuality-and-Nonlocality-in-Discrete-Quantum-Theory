\begin{abstract}
We present a mathematical framework based on quantum interval-valued
probability measures to study the effect of experimental imperfections
and finite precision measurements on defining aspects of quantum
mechanics such as contextuality and the Born rule. While foundational
results such as the Kochen-Specker and Gleason theorems fail to hold
in general in a world with limited resources, when we allow infinite
precision, their validity is recovered.  However, we are able to use
the interval-valued framework to establish bounds on the validity of
those theorems in realistic experimental environments. In this way,
not only can we quantify the idea of finite-precision measurement
within our theory, but we can also suggest a possible resolution of
the Meyer-Mermin debate on the impact of finite-precision measurement
on the Kochen-Specker theorem.

\section{Introduction}

There are long-standing debates in the foundations of quantum
mechanics regarding the tension between finite precision measurement
and contextuality~\cite{BarrettKent2004,Appleby_2005}, which refers
to the fact that the results of measuring compatible sets of
observables depend on whether they are measured together or
separately.  For example, Meyer~\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751} and
Mermin~\cite{Mermin1999} disagree on whether finite-precision
measurements invalidate the spirit of the Kochen-Specker
theorem~\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum}, which is a
mathematical statement about contextuality.  The Kochen-Specker
theorem asserts that, in a Hilbert space of dimension $d \ge 3$, it is
impossible to associate definite measured values, $\mu(P_i)= 0$ or
$1$, with every projection operator~$P_i$, in such a way that, if a
set of commuting $P_i$ satisfies $\sum_i P_i = 1$, then
$\sum_i \mu(P_i) = 1$. In contrast, Meyer showed that one {\it can\/}
assign definite values $0$ or $1$ to the measurement outcome
$\mu(P_i)$ when the Hilbert space is defined over the field of
rational numbers, therefore nullifying the
theorem~\citep{PhysRevLett.83.3751}.  However, Mermin then argued
that measurement outcomes must depend smoothly on slight changes in
the experimental configuration. Mermin therefore claimed that the
impact of Meyer's negative result is
``unsupportable''~\citep{Mermin1999}.  Discussion has continued on
whether contextuality is consistent with experimental
outcomes~\citep{Kent1999,HavlicekKrennSummhammerSvozil2001,SimonBruknerZeilinger2001,Cabello2002,Larsson2002,Appleby2002,Peres2003,BarrettKent2004,Appleby_2005,Spekkens2005,GuehneKleinmannCabelloEtAl2010,MazurekPuseyKunjwalEtAl2016}.
A fundamental question is how to address this controversy by
developing mathematical theories of quantum mechanics that are
intrinsically, rather than only implicitly, consistent with the
resources available for the realistic accuracy of an actual
measurement.

In this paper, we extend our previous work on the foundations of
computability in quantum physics by exploring the application of
interval-valued probability measures (IVPM) to achieving a coherent
formulation of finite-resource quantum mechanics.  To this end, we
develop a mathematical framework that includes the uncertainties of
finite precision and imperfections in the quantum measurement
process. In particular, we quantify the concept of imperfect quantum
measurement and its impact on the interpretation of the Kochen-Specker
and Gleason theorems and their implications for the foundations of
quantum mechanics.  Our first observation is that essential objectives
of our program to achieve a computable theory of quantum mechanics and
finite-resource measurement, attempted previously with computable
number systems~\cite{usat,geometry2013apsrev4,DQT2014}, may be
achievable by extending classical interval-valued probability
measures~\cite{JamisonLodwick2004} to the quantum domain.  We thus
begin by axiomatizing a quantum interval-valued probability measure
(QIVPM) framework.

The effect of finite precision and imperfections on contextuality and
the Kochen-Specker theorem is shown to have a resolution in terms of
our QIVPM framework.  To proceed, we use a formulation of the
``Mermin-Peres square''~\cite{peres1995quantum,Mermin1990Simple}
that uses the expectation value of a physical observable with respect
to a QIVPM, where the interval-valued expectation value is consistent
with the expectation value of the same observable in conventional
quantum mechanics with infinite resources. We show that, as long as
errors and uncertainties remain smaller than a particular value, the
Kochen-Specker theorem remains valid. In other words, we established a
rigorous bound for its validity and, therefore, the limits for
physical reality to remain contextual.

A key aspect of a quantum measurement is its statistical nature, as
reflected by application of the Born rule to determine the probability
of a given measurement
outcome~\citep{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199}. The Gleason
theorem establishes that there is no alternative to the Born rule by
demonstrating, using reasonable continuity arguments in Hilbert spaces
of dimension $d\ge3$, the existence of a unique state $\rho$
consistent with the statistical predictions computed from that
rule~\citep{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum}.  It is
then legitimate to question what happens when infinite precision
cannot be achieved. We will show that, if the effect of finite
precision is incorporated, while a QIVPM might not be consistent with
a unique state~$\rho$ on all projectors defined on a Hilbert space
of dimension $d\ge3$, there is a mathematically precise sense in which
one recovers the original Gleason theorem asymptotically.
Specifically, if for bounded resources the QIVPM is induced by some
states~$\rho'$, those states will converge to a unique state $\rho$
when the size of the intervals characterizing the uncertainties tends
to zero.

The paper is organized as follows.  In Sec.\ \ref{sec:fuzzy} we begin
by introducing the foundations of quantum probability space and fuzzy
measurement.  We then move on to introduce the concept of quantum
interval valued probability in Sec.\ \ref{sec:Interval-Uncertainty}.
This QIVPM will provide the mathematical framework to quantify the
impact of finite precision measurements on quantum mechanics.  For
instance, in Sec.\ \ref{sec:Kochen-Specker}, we quantify the domain of
validity of a contextual measurement, thus addressing the conditions
under which the Kochen-Specker theorem applies.  This provides a way
of resolving the Meyer-Mermin debate, which is the main result of our
Thm~\ref{cor:Kochen-Specker-IVPM}.  In Sec.\ \ref{sec:Gleason}, we
study Gleason's theorem in the context of imprecise measurements,
concluding that QIVPM provides a framework with quantitative bounds in
which Gleason's theorem, while formally invalid in a universe with
bounded resources, holds asymptotically in a mathematically precise
way.  Finally, we present our conclusions in
Sec.~\ref{sec:Conclusion}.

\section{Fuzzy Measurements}
\label{sec:fuzzy}

A \emph{probability space} is a mathematical abstraction specifying
the necessary conditions for reasoning coherently about collections of
uncertain
events~\cite{Kolmogorov1950,544199,Griffiths2003,Grabisch2016}. In the
quantum case, the events of interest are specified by \emph{projection
  operators} $P$. These include the empty projector~$\mathbb{0}$,
the identity projector~$\mathbb{1}$, projectors of the form
$\proj{\phi}$ where $\ket{\phi}$ is a pure quantum state (an element
of a Hilbert space), sums of \emph{orthogonal} projectors $P_0$
and~$P_1$ with $P_0P_1=\mathbb{0}$, and products of \emph{commuting}
projectors $P_0$ and~$P_1$ with $P_0P_1=P_1P_0$. In a well-defined
quantum probability
space~\cite{10.2307/2308516,gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,Maassen2010},
each event $P_{i}$ is mapped to a probability~$\mu(P_{i})$ using a
probability measure~$\mu:\events\rightarrow[0,1]$, where $\events$
is the set of all projectors on a given Hilbert space, subject to the
following constraints: $\mu(\mathbb{0})=0$, $\mu(\mathbb{1})=1$,
$\mu\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=1-\mu\left(P\right)$, and for each pair
of \emph{orthogonal} projectors $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$:
\begin{equation}
{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)={\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\,.\label{eq:QuantumProbability-Addition}
\end{equation}

\noindent A quantum probability measure can be easily constructed if
one knows the current state of the quantum system by using the Born
rule.  Specifically, for each pure normalized quantum state
$\ket{\phi}$, the Born rule induces a probability measure
$\mu_{\phi}^{\mathrm{B}}$ defined as
$\mu_{\phi}^{\mathrm{B}}(P)=\ip{\phi}{P\phi}$. The situation
generalizes to mixed states
$\rho = \sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}\proj{\phi_{j}}$, where
$\sum_{j=1}^{N}q_{j}=1$ in which case the generalized Born rule
induces a probability measure $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ defined as
$\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right) = \Tr\left(\rho P\right) =
\sum_{j=1}^{N}
q_{j}\mu_{\phi_{j}}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)$~\cite{peres1995quantum,544199,Jaeger2007}.

As an example, consider a three-dimensional Hilbert space with
orthonormal basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\}$ and an observable
$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral decomposition
$\proj{0} + 2\,\proj{1} + 3\,\proj{2}$. Two fragments of valid
probability measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ that can associated with this
space are: $\mu_1(\proj{0}) = 0.5$, $\mu_1(\proj{1}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_1(\proj{2}) = 0$, and $\mu_2(\proj{0}) = 0.5$,
$\mu_2(\proj{1}) = 0$, $\mu_2(\proj{2}) = 0.5$. By the Born rule, the
first probability measure corresponds to the quantum system being in
the pure state $(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}$ and the second
corresponds to the quantum system being in the pure state
$(\ket{0}+\alpha\ket{2})/\sqrt{2}$, where in both cases
$|\alpha|=1$. The expectation value of the observable in the first
case is 1.5 and in the second it is 2.

The above axioms describe a mathematical idealization involving
infinitely precise measurements. In an actual experimental setup with
an ensemble of quantum states that are not exactly identical, and with
small imperfections and inaccuracies in measuring devices, an
experimenter might only be able to determine that the probability of
the event $\proj{0}$ is in the range $[0.49,0.51]$ instead of
precisely 0.5. The spread in this range depends on the amount of
resources (time, energy, money, etc.) that are devoted to the
experiment. In the classical setting, this ``fuzziness'' can be
formalized by moving to \emph{interval-valued probability measures},
which we explore in the next section, along with our proposed
extension to the quantum domain.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Intervals of Uncertainty}
\label{sec:Interval-Uncertainty}

We will start by reviewing IVPMs in the classical setting and then
propose our quantum generalization. In the classical setting, there
are several proposals for ``imprecise
probabilities''~\citep{Dempster1967,Shafer1976,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Weichselberger2000,JamisonLodwick2004,HuberRonchetti2009,Grabisch2016}.
Although these proposals differ in some details, they all share the
fact that the probability $\mu(E)$ of an event~$E$ is generalized from
a single \emph{real number} to an \emph{interval}~$[\ell,r]$
where~$\ell$ intuitively corresponds to the strength of evidence for
the event~$E$ and~$1-r$ corresponds to the strength of evidence
against the same event. The collection of intervals used in the
definition of a probability measure must satisfy certain properties
that we explain next.

First, for each interval $[\ell,r]$ we have the natural constraint
$0 \leq \ell \leq r \leq 1$ that guarantees that every element of the
interval can be interpreted as a conventional probability. We also
include $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ as limiting intervals to
refer to the probability of impossible events (e.g., the null event)
and events that are certain (e.g., the event covering the entire
sample space).  For each interval $[\ell,r]$, we also need the
interval $[1-r,1-\ell]$ so that if one interval refers to the
probability of an event, the other refers to the probability of the
event's complement.  For example, if we discover as a result of an
experiment that $\mu(E) = [0.2,0.3]$ for some event~$E$, we may
conclude that $\mu(\overline{E}) = [0.7,0.8]$ for the complement event
$\overline{E}$. In addition to these simple conditions, there are some
subtle conditions on how intervals are combined, which we discuss
next.

Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be two disjoint events with probabilities
$\mu(E_1)=[\ell_1,r_1]$ and $\mu(E_2)=[\ell_2,r_2]$. A first attempt
at calculating the probability of the combined event that
\emph{either} $E_1$ or $E_2$ occurs might be
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$. In some cases, this is
indeed a sensible definition. For example, if $\mu(E_1)=[0.1,0.2]$ and
$\mu(E_2)=[0.3,0.4]$ we get $\mu(E_1\cup E_2) = [0.4,0.6]$. But
consider an event $E$ such that $\mu(E)=[0.2,0.3]$ and hence
$\mu(\overline{E})=[0.7,0.8]$. The two events $E$ and $\overline{E}$
are disjoint; the previous naïve way of combining the intervals would
give $\mu(E\cup\overline{E})=[0.9,1.1]$ which is not a valid
probability interval. Moreover the event $E\cup\overline{E}$ is the
identity event covering the entire space; its probability interval
should be $[1,1]$ which is sharper than $[0.9,1.1]$. The problem is
that the two intervals are correlated: there is more information in
the combined event than in each event separately. In our example, even
though the true probability of $\mu(E)$ can be anywhere in the range
$[0.2,0.3]$ and the true probability of $\mu(\overline{E})$ can be in
anywhere in the range $[0.7,0.8]$, the values are not independent. Any
value of $\mu(E) \leq 0.25$ will force $\mu(\overline{E})\geq
0.75$. To account for such subtleties, the axioms of interval-valued
probability do not use a strict equality for the combination of
disjoint events. The correct constraint regarding the probability of
$E_1\cup E_2$ when $E_1$ and $E_2$ are disjoint is
$\mu(E_1\cup E_2) \subseteq [\ell_1+\ell_2,r_1+r_2]$ which, in
combination with the requirement for the identity event would force
$\mu(E \cup \overline{E})$ to always be $[1,1]$ irrespective of the
particular assignments of $\mu(E)$ or~$\mu(\overline{E})$.

When combining non-disjoint events, there is a further subtlety whose
resolution will give us the final general condition for IVPMs. For
general, not necessarily disjoint, events $E_1$ and $E_2$, we have:
\begin{equation}
\mu(E_1\cup E_2) + \mu(E_1\cap E_2) \subseteq \mu(E_1) + \mu(E_2)
\label{eq:classicalconvex}
\end{equation}
which is a generalization of the classical inclusion-exclusion
principle that uses $\subseteq$ instead of $=$ for the same reason as
before. The new condition, known as
\emph{convexity}~\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Marinacci1999,Grabisch2016},
reduces to the previously
motivated condition when the events are disjoint, i.e., when
$\mu(E_1\cap E_2) = 0$.

We now have the necessary ingredients to define the quantum extension,
QIVPMs, as a generalization of both classical IVPMs and conventional
quantum probability measures. We will show that QIVPMs reduce to
classical IVPMs when the space of quantum events is restricted to
mutually commuting sub-events, i.e., to compatible events that can be
measured simultaneously.

\begin{definition}[QIVPM]
  Assume a collection of intervals $\mathscr{I}$ including
  $\imposs=[0,0]$ and $\necess=[1,1]$ with addition and scalar
  multiplication defined as follows:
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:interval-operations}
  \begin{eqnarray}
   &  & [\ell_{1},r_{1}]+[\ell_{2},r_{2}]=[\ell_{1}+\ell_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]\textrm{ and}\\
   &  & x[\ell,r]=\begin{cases}
  [x\ell,xr] & \textrm{for }x\ge0\,;\\{}
  [xr,x\ell] & \textrm{for }x\le0\,.
  \end{cases}
  \end{eqnarray}
  \end{subequations}
  Then we take a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}$ to be an assignment of an interval to each
  event (projection operator~$P$) subject to the following constraints:
  \begin{subequations}\label{eq:QIVPM-constraints}
  \begin{eqnarray}
   &  & \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\left[0,0\right]\,,\\
   &  & \bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\left[1,1\right]\,,\\
   &  & \bar{\mu}\left(\mathbb{1}-P\right)=\left[1,1\right]-\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\,,
  \end{eqnarray}
  \end{subequations}
  and satisfying for each pair of \emph{commuting} projectors $P_0$
  and $P_1$ with $P_0P_1=P_1P_0$,
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}-P_{0}P_{1}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}P_{1}\right)\subseteq\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)+\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\,.
\label{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\noindent The first three constraints,
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:QIVPM-constraints}), are the direct counterpart of the
corresponding ones for classical IVPMs.  With the understanding that
the union of classical sets $E_1\cup E_2$ is replaced by
$P_0+P_1-P_0P_1$ in the case of quantum projection
operators~\cite{Griffiths2003}, the last condition,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:QuantumInterval-valuedProbability-Inclusion}), is a
direct counterpart of Eq.~(\ref{eq:classicalconvex}). Thus our
definition of QIVPMs merges classical IVPMs with conventional quantum
probability measures.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:Gleason}, we will show that QIVPMs generalize
conventional quantum probability measures in the limit where each the
lower and upper end of each interval coincide exactly and the
intervals cover $[0,1]$. In this section, we will show that our
definition of QIVPMs is consistent with classical IVPMs in the sense
that a restriction of QIVPMs to commuting events recovers the
definition of classical IVPMs.

To formalize this connection between QIVPMs and classical IVPMs, we
first note that in contrast to the case with conventional quantum
probability spaces, there is generally no unique state $\rho$
consistent with a QIVPM. We say that a QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$ is consistent
with a state $\rho$ and projector $P$ if the interval $\bar{\mu}(P)$
contains the exact probability calculated by the Born rule, i.e, if:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)=\Tr\left(\rho P\right)$
is the probability that the event~$P$ happens determined by the Born
rule~\citep{Born1983,peres1995quantum,544199}. 

We generalize this consistency relation to sets of states and general
subspaces of events as follows. A set of events $\events'$ is a
\emph{subspace} if it contains $\mathbb{0}$ and $\mathbb{1}$ and is
closed under complements and sums, i.e., for any
projector~$P\in\events'$, we have $\mathbb{1}-P\in\events'$ and for
each pair of orthogonal projectors~$P_0 \in \events'$ and
$P_1 \in \events'$, we have $(P_0 + P_1) \in \events'$. Given a
probability measure $\bar{\mu}$ and a subspace of events $\events'$,
we denote the collection $\coreBorn(\bar{\mu},\events')$ of all states
that are consistent with $\bar{\mu}$ on every projector in $\events'$
as:
\begin{equation}
\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)=\set{\rho}{\forall P\in \events',~\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)\in\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)}.
\end{equation}

In the long version of this paper, we establish that QIVPMs become
classical IVPMs when the space of events includes only mutually
commuting events. The idea of the proof is as follows. Given a
subspace of commuting events $\events_C$, we can construct a partial
orthonormal basis by diagonalization and complete it to a full
orthonornal basis $\overline{\events_C}$. We then build a bijection
between the QIVPM on the set of projectors associated with this basis
and the set of classical events corresponding to this basis. This
correspondence leads to a crucial property in our setting. 

\begin{thm}\label{thm:Shapley}
  For a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, if a subspace
  of events~$\events_C\subseteq\events$ commutes, then
  $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events_C\right)\ne\emptyset$.
\end{thm}

The theorem follows directly from our correspondence and Shapley's
theorem that proves that a classical IVPM always contains at least one
state that is consistent with every
event~\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}. As we will
illustrate in the next section, the set of states
$\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)$ that is consistent with
some events $\events'$ and a particular QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$ may be
\emph{empty}.

For example, a well-defined  
QIVPM, assuming the three intervals $\imposs$, $\necess$, and
$\unknown=\left[0,1\right]$, is:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}_{1}\left(P\right)=\begin{cases}
\imposs\,, & \text{if }P=\mathbb{0}\text{ ;}\\
\necess\,, & \text{if }P=\mathbb{1}\text{ ;}\\
\unknown\,, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\label{eq:no-information-IVPM}
\end{equation}
This measure represents the beliefs of an experimenter with no prior
knowledge about the particular quantum system in question; any quantum
state would be consistent with $\bar{\mu}_{1}$ on any projectors, and
$\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu}_{1},\events\right)$ is just the set of all
states. The subspace
$\events_{0}=\left\{ \mathbb{0},\proj{0},\proj{1},\mathbb{1}\right\} $
is a subspace of commuting events. Indeed restricting $\bar{\mu}_{1}$
to $\events_{0}$, $\bar{\mu}_{1}|_{\events_{0}}$, gives a classical
IVPM~$\bar{\mu}_{2}$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{0}) & =\imposs & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{0}) & =\unknown\\
\bar{\mu}_{2}(\mathbb{1}) & =\necess & \bar{\mu}_{2}(\proj{1}) & =\unknown
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
If we identify the states ~$\proj{0}$ and $\proj{1}$ with the head
and the tail of a coin, respectively, then $\bar{\mu}_{2}$ represents
the situation in which that an experimenter knows nothing about a coin
before she tosses it. Moreover, for each $p\in\left[0,1\right]$, the
state~$p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$ represents a classical
coin with probability~$p$ to get heads, and
$p\proj{0}+\left(1-p\right)\proj{1}$ is consistent with
$\bar{\mu}_{2}$ on $\events_{0}$ because any classical coin should be
consistent with the situation for which an experimenter has no prior
knowledge.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Kochen-Specker} 
  \label{sec:Kochen-Specker}
  
Our first result is that a QIVPM is consistent with the inability to avoid
uncertainty found in conventional infinite precise quantum
mechanics~\cite{PeresRon1988,peres1995quantum}. 

\begin{thm}[Kochen-Specker~\cite{kochenspecker1967,peres1995quantum,Redhead1987-REDINA}]\label{thm:Kochen-Specker}
  Given a Hilbert space $\Hilb$ of dimension~$d\ge3$, there is no
  0-deterministic
  measure~$\mu^{\mathrm{D}}:\events\rightarrow\left\{ 0,1\right\}
  $.\end{thm}

We will adapt the proof of the Kochen-Specker
theorem~\cite{kochenspecker1967,
  peres1995quantum,Redhead1987-REDINA,Griffiths2003} to show that it
is, in general, impossible to have just the two intervals \imposs\ and
\necess: every QIVPM must be parameterized by a collection of
intervals that includes at least one additional ``fuzzy'' interval and
some events must be associated with such uncertain intervals. The
significance of this observation is that the uncertainty in the
intervals is, in contrast to the classical case, \emph{a fundamental
  part of quantum theory}. There are in fact two sources of
uncertainty: one due to the finite measurement resources and one due
to complementarity, which requires every quantum framework to be truly
probabilistic.

We will proceed by assuming a 0-deterministic QIVPM $\bar{\mu}$ and
derive a contradiction using the following nine ``Mermin-Peres
square''
observables~$\mathbf{O}_{ij}$~\cite{Mermin1990Simple,peres1995quantum}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
$\mathbb{1}\otimes\sigma_{z}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\mathbb{1}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
$\sigma_{x}\otimes\mathbb{1}$  & $\mathbb{1}\otimes\sigma_{x}$  & $\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{x}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
$\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{z}$  & $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{x}$  & $\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y}$ \tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}\,,
\par\end{center}

\noindent where $\left\{\mathbb{1},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y},\sigma_{z}\right\}$ are
Pauli matrices acting on a pair of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ states. We now define the
expectation value of the QIVPM for our Mermin-Peres square.

\begin{definition}Given a Hilbert space $\Hilb$ of dimension~$d\ge3$,
  for every QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, any
  observable~$\mathbf{O}$ with spectral decomposition
  $\mathbf{O}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}P_{i}$, and the minimal
  subspace of events $\events'$ containing
  $\left\{ P_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N}$, we have
\begin{equation}
\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\left[\min_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho},\max_{\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)}\expval{\mathbf{O}}_{\rho}\right]\,.\label{eq:quantum-interval-expectation-core}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

The expectation value is intuitively between two possible outcomes,
which themselves lie between the minimum and maximum bounds of the
given probability intervals. (This definition is consistent with the
classical Choquet integral on subspaces of commuting events by
adopting the classical
results~\cite{GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}.)  If the QIVPM is
0-deterministic, this interval collapses to a singleton
$\left\{ \lambda\right\} $, where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue
of~$\mathbf{O}$. If we define the multiplication of two singleton
sets~$\left\{ \lambda_{1}\right\} $ and $\left\{ \lambda_{2}\right\} $
to be $\left\{ \lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\right\} $, then we have
\begin{equation}
\prod_{j=1}^{N}\expval{\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}=\expval{\prod_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{O}_{j}}_{\bar{\mu}}\label{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}
\end{equation}
for any set of commuting observables~$\left\{ \mathbf{O}_{j}\right\}
_{j=1}^{N}$.

Since the expectation value~$\expval{\cdot}_{\bar{\mu}}$ satisfies
these two properties, the observables in the Mermin-Peres square must
have the expectation value~$\left\{ 1\right\} $ or
$\left\{ -1\right\} $.  In each row and column, the operators commute,
and each operator is the product of two others, except in the third
column, where
$\left(\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}\right)\left(\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{x}\right)=-\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y}$.
Therefore, it is clearly impossible to find a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}$ such
that $\langle \mathbf{O}_{ij}\rangle_{\bar \mu}$ satisfies
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Kochen-Specker-Rules}).

The question now is what happens if we relax the perfect measurement
assumption that the intervals are precisely $[0,0]$ and
$[1,1]$. We need to examine what happens if
measurement imperfections occasionally cause an
ideally impossible event to be detected or an ideally certain event
not to be detected. Mermin argues in this case that:
\begin{quote}
  \ldots although the outcomes deduced from such imperfect
  measurements will occasionally differ dramatically from those
  allowed in the ideal case, if the misalignment is very slight, the
  statistical distribution of outcomes will differ only slightly from
  the ideal case~\citep{Mermin1999}.
\end{quote}

We can formally test this hypothesis by considering the notion of
a $\delta$-deterministic QIVPM below. 

\begin{definition}\label{def:delta-deterministic}We define
  QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$
  as $\delta$-deterministic if either
  $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]$ or
  $\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[1-\delta,1\right]$ for any
  $P\in\events$.\end{definition}

As $\delta$ gets bigger, the QIVPM allows more and more indeterminate
behavior. A $\frac{1}{3}$-deterministic QIVPM can be given by
$\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)=\left[x/3,x/3\right]$, where $P$ projects
onto an $x$-dimensional subspace of a three-dimensional Hilbert space.

We now prove that for small enough $\delta$, the Kochen-Specker result is
still valid, i.e., if the measurement imperfections are small enough,
we cannot nullify the Kochen-Specker theorem as
Meyer~\cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751} argued. 

\begin{thm}\label{cor:Kochen-Specker-IVPM} Given a Hilbert space $\Hilb$
  of dimension~$d\ge3$, there is no $\delta$-deterministic QIVPM for
  $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$.\end{thm}

\begin{proof} Suppose there is a $\delta$-deterministic
  QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, we claim that the
  following function~$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}:\events\rightarrow\left\{
    \imposs,\necess\right\} $ is a cryptodeterministic QIVPM:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P\right)=\begin{cases}
\imposs\,, & \textrm{ if }\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]\:;\\
\necess\,, & \textrm{ if }\bar{\mu}\left(P\right)\subseteq\left[1-\delta,1\right]\:.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
However, since we know that there is no cryptodeterministic QIVPM,
$\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}$ cannot exist and hence $\bar{\mu}$ cannot
exist.

It remains to verify that $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}$ is a cryptodeterministic
QIVPM by checking the properties of
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}\right)=\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{1}\right)=\imposs\\
 & \Rightarrow & \bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)=\imposs
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}for orthogonal operators~$P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$.

When $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}\right)=\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{1}\right)=\imposs$,
we have both $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}\right)$ and $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{1}\right)\subseteq\left[0,\delta\right]$
which implies $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)\subseteq\left[0,2\delta\right]$.
Since $\delta<\frac{1}{3}\Rightarrow2\delta<1-\delta$, $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$
cannot be a subset of $\left[1-\delta,1\right]$, but $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$
is a subset of either $\left[0,\delta\right]$ or $\left[1-\delta,1\right]$.
Hence, $\bar{\mu}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)$ must be a subset of $\left[0,\delta\right]$,
which implies $\bar{\mu}^{\textrm{D}}\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right)=\imposs$. Thus the
theorem holds when $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Gleason}
\label{sec:Gleason}

In the classical setting, measurements done with limited resources and
poor precision may not uniquely identify the true state of a
system. However, there is always at least one state that is consistent
with the imprecise measurements.

\begin{thm}[Shapley~\cite{Shapley1971,GilboaSchmeidler1994,Grabisch2016}]\label{thm:Shapley}
  For a QIVPM~$\bar{\mu}:\events\rightarrow\mathscr{I}$, if a subspace
  of events~$\events'\subseteq\events$ commutes, then
  $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events'\right)\ne\emptyset$.
\end{thm}

In the idealized situation of real-valued quantum probability
measures, Gleason's theorem asserts that every measure is determined
by a unique state. 

\begin{thm}[Gleason~\cite{gleason1957,Redhead1987-REDINA,peres1995quantum}]\label{cor:Gleason's}In
a Hilbert space $\Hilb$ of dimension $d\geq3$, given a quantum probability
measure~$\mu:\events\rightarrow[0,1]$, there exists a unique 
state~$\rho$ such that $\mu=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$.
\end{thm}

Thm.~\ref{thm:Shapley} is weaker: it asserts that, for each classical
subspace of events, a QIVPM must be consistent with \emph{some}
state. But the states consistent with different subspaces may be
incomparable, as the following example shows.

\begin{example}\label{ex:three-dimensional-three-value}
  Given a three-dimensional Hilbert space $\Hilb$ with an orthonormal
  basis $\left\{ \ket{0},\ket{1},\ket{2}\right\} $, let
  $\mathscr{I}_{1}=\left\{ \necess,\imposs,\unknown\right\} $,
  $\ket{\ps}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{1}\right)/\sqrt{2}$,
  $\ket{\ps'}=\left(\ket{0}+\ket{2}\right)/\sqrt{2}$, and
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \begin{aligned}\imposs & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps'})\,,
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \begin{aligned}\necess & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1})=\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{0})\\
 & =\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps})=\bar{\mu}(\mathbb{1}-\proj{\ps'})\,,
\end{aligned}
\\
 &  & \unknown=\bar{\mu}(P)\qquad\textrm{otherwise.}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
It is straightforward to verify that $\bar{\mu}$
is a QIVPM. Now let $S_{1}=\left\{ \proj{0},\proj{\ps}\right\} $.
Because $\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\imposs$, we have
$\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{0})=\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}(\proj{\ps})=0$
for any state~$\rho\in\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{1}\right)$.
Hence, $\rho$ cannot be any state other than $\ket{2}$, the only
pure state orthogonal to both $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{\ps}$, and it
is easy to verify $\proj{2}$ is actually in $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{1}\right)$.
Similarly, let $S_{2}=\left\{ \proj{0},\proj{\ps'}\right\} $. We
have $\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{2}\right)=\left\{ \proj{1}\right\} $.
Therefore, 
\begin{equation}
\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},\events\right)\subseteq\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{1}\right)\cap\coreBorn\left(\bar{\mu},S_{2}\right)=\emptyset
\end{equation}
Thus, there is no state that is consistent with the QIVPM on all projectors~$\events$,
so Gleason's theorem does not hold for at least this example.
\end{example}

Although Gleason's theorem does not hold for every QIVPM, we can show
that for a certain class of QIVPMs, the collection of states
consistent with the projectors get closer and closer to each other as
the intervals get narrower and narrower, eventually collapsing to a
single state when the intervals become infinitely precise real
numbers. To state this result, we introduce a few technical notions. 

We call a state $\rho$ a \emph{totally mixed state} if
$0<\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(P\right)<1$ for any
$P\in\events\backslash\left\{ \mathbb{0},\mathbb{1}\right\} $. We also
define a notion of distance based on the following norm of a
matrix~$A$ as
$\left\Vert A\right\Vert
=\max_{\ip{\psi}{\psi}=1}\left|\melem{\psi}{A}{\psi}\right|$~\citep{544199}. Now
consider the following collection of intervals:
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\mathscr{I}}_{n} & = & \set{\left[\frac{k-1}{2n},\frac{k+1}{2n}\right]\cap\left[0,1\right]}{k=0,\ldots,2n}\nonumber \\
 &  & \cup\left\{ \left[0,0\right],\left[1,1\right]\right\} 
\end{eqnarray}
which are overlapping intervals with length~$1/n$ except the intervals
at each end. 

A totally mixed state induces a QIVPM over the intervals above as
follows. We first define a map $\widehat{\iota}_{n}$ from the interval
$[0,1]$ to the collection of intervals as:
\begin{itemize}
\item when $x=0$ or $x=1$, $\widehat{\iota}_{n}\left(x\right)=\left[x,x\right]$;
\item when $0<x<1$, $\widehat{\iota}_{n}\left(x\right)=\left[\frac{k-1}{2n},\frac{k+1}{2n}\right]\cap\left[0,1\right]$,
where $k$ is defined by one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $k$ even and $k-0.5\le2nx\le k+0.5$;
\item $k$ odd and $k-0.5<2nx<k+0.5$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

It is now not difficult to verify that for any totally mixed
state~$\rho$ on a three-dimensional Hilbert space,
$\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ is a
QIVPM. Furthermore, we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\left\Vert \rho-\rho'\right\Vert \le1/\left(12n\right)$,
$\rho'\in\coreBorn\left(\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}},\events\right)$.
\item If $\rho'\in\coreBorn\left(\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}},\events\right)$,
then $\left\Vert \rho-\rho'\right\Vert \le1/n$.
\end{itemize}
In other words, for the states consistent with this QIVPM,
$\widehat{\iota}_{n}\circ\mu_{\rho}^{\mathrm{B}}$ will become closer and
closer to $\rho'$ as $n$ goes to infinity. In the limiting case when
the intervals are infinitely precise, i.e.,
$\set{\left[x,x\right]}{x\in\left[0,1\right]}$, any QIVPM can be
recast as a real-valued one and will have a unique state consistent
with it on every projector when $d\ge3$.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
  
Foundational concepts in quantum mechanics, such as the Kochen-Specker
and Gleason theorems, rely in a very subtle way on the use of
unbounded resources. By assuming infinitely precise measurements,
these two insightful theorems underlie two fundamental aspects of
quantum mechanics. On the one hand, Kochen-Specker's result reveals a
distinctive aspect of physical reality, the fact that it is
contextual, and, on the other hand, Gleason's theorem establishes a
relationship between quantum states and probabilities uniquely defined
by Born's rule.  Our goal in this paper has been to analyze the
physical consequences of a mathematical framework that allows for
finite precision measurements by introducing the concept of quantum
interval-valued probability. This framework incorporates uncertainty
in the measurement results by defining fuzzy probability measures, and
includes standard quantum measurement as the particular instance of
sharp, infinitely precise, intervals.  In addition, we showed how
these two theorems emerge as limiting cases of this same framework,
thus connecting two seemingly unrelated aspects of quantum physics. We
noted that {\it arbitrary\/} finite precision measurement conditions
can nullify the main tenets of both theorems. However, by carefully
specifying experimental uncertainties, we were able to establish
rigorous bounds on the validity of these two theorems. Therefore, we
have established a context in which infinite precision quantum
mechanical theories can be reconciled with finite precision quantum
mechanical measurements, and have provided a possible resolution of
the Meyer-Mermin debate on the impact of finite precision on the
Kochen-Specker theorem \cite{PhysRevLett.83.3751,Mermin1999}.

  abstract    = {In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies with time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus, techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one may impair performance. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the system. The tool whose use we advocate is random-set theory (RST): applying this, we derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters comprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive Bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a posteriori probability (APP) density of the unknown user parameters, and use this density to derive optimum detectors. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to interferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Information is inevitably tied to a physical representation and therefore to restrictions and possibilities related to the laws of physics and the parts available in the universe. Quantum mechanical superpositions of information bearing states can be used, and the real utility of that needs to be understood. Quantum parallelism in computation is one possibility and will be assessed pessimistically. The energy dissipation requirements of computation, of measurement and of the communications link are discussed. The insights gained from the analysis of computation has caused a reappraisal of the perceived wisdom in the other two fields. A concluding section speculates about the nature of the laws of physics, which are algorithms for the handling of information, and must be executable in our real physical universe. },

A convex game is defined as one that is based on a convex set function. In this paper it is shown that the core of a convex game is not empty and that it has an especially regular structure. It is further shown that certain other cooperative solution concepts are related in a simple way to the core: The value of a convex game is the center of gravity of the extreme points of the core, and the von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set solution of a convex game is unique and coincides with the core.},

Most notably, we show that there is no Kochen-Specker coloring of the $n \times n$ idempotent integer matrices for $n \geq 3$, thereby illustrating that Kochen-Specker contextuality is an inherent feature of pure matrix algebra. We apply this to generalize recent no-go results on noncommutative spectrum functors, showing that any contravariant functor from rings to sets (respectively, topological spaces or locales) that restricts to the Zariski prime spectrum functor for commutative rings must assign the empty set (respectively, empty space or locale) to the matrix ring $M_n(R)$ for any integer $n \geq 3$ and any ring $R$. An appendix by Alexandru Chirvasitu shows that Kochen-Specker colorings of idempotents in partial subalgebras of $M_3(F)$ for a perfect field $F$ can be extended to partial algebra morphisms into the algebraic closure of $F$.},

QBism has its roots in personalist Bayesian probability theory, is crucially dependent upon the tools of quantum information theory, and most recently, has set out to investigate whether the physical world might be of a type sketched by some false-started philosophies of 100 years ago (pragmatism, pluralism, nonreductionism, and meliorism). Beyond conceptual issues, work at Perimeter Institute is focused on the hard technical problem of finding a good representation of quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities, without amplitudes or Hilbert-space operators. The best candidate representation involves a mysterious entity called a symmetric informationally complete quantum measurement. Contemplation of it gives a way of thinking of the Born Rule as an addition to the rules of probability theory, applicable when an agent considers gambling on the consequences of his interactions with a newly recognized universal capacity: dimension (formerly Hilbert-space dimension). (The word "capacity" should conjure up an image of something like gravitational mass---a body's mass measures its capacity to attract other bodies. With hindsight one can say that the founders of quantum mechanics discovered another universal capacity, "dimension.") The article ends by showing that the egocentric elements in QBism represent no impediment to pursuing quantum cosmology and outlining some directions for future work.},

@article{citeulike:321509,
    abstract = {The  ” computable” numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose
expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means. Although the subject of this
paper is ostensibly the computable numbers, it is almost equally easy to define and
investigate computable functions of an integral variable or a real or computable variable,
computable predicates, and so forth. The fundamental problems involved are, however,
the same in each case, and I have chosen the computable numbers for explicit treatment
as involving the least cumbrous technique. I hope shortly to give an account of the
relations of the computable numbers, functions, and so forth to one another. This will
include a development of the theory of functions of a real variable expressed in terms of
computable numbers. According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal
can be written down by a machine.
In {\S}{\S} 9, 10 I give some arguments with the intention of showing that the computable
numbers include all numbers which could naturally be regarded as computable. In
particular, I show that certain large classes of numbers are computable. They include, for
instance, the real parts of all algebraic numbers, the real parts of the zeros of the Bessel functions, the numbers X, e, etc. The computable numbers do not, however, include all
definable numbers, and an example is given of a definable number which is not
computable.
Although the class of computable numbers is so great, and in many ways similar to the
class of real numbers, it is nevertheless enumerable. In {\S}8 I examine certain arguments
which would seem to prove the contrary. By the correct application of one of these
arguments, conclusions are reached which are superficially similar to those of G\"{o}del [1] .
These results {231} have valuable applications. In particular, it is shown ({\S}11) that the
Hilbertian Entscheidungsproblem can have no solution.
In a recent paper Alonzo Church[2] has introduced an idea of  ” effective calculability”,
which is equivalent to my  ” computability”, but is very differently defined. Church also
reaches similar conclusions about the Entscheidungsproblem.[3] The proof of
equivalence between  ” computability” and  ” effective calculability” is outlined in an
appendix to the present paper.},

The soundness and completeness of the theory are with respect to the previously developed denotational semantics of QML. The completeness proof also gives rise to a normalisation algorithm following the normalisation-by-evaluation approach. The current work focuses on the pure fragment of QML, omitting measurements.},

The effectful part can be modelled using a generalisation of monads called arrows. We express the resulting executable model of quantum computing in the Haskell programming language using its special syntax for arrow computations. However, the embedding in Haskell is not perfect: a faithful model of quantum computing requires type capabilities that are not directly expressible in Haskell.},

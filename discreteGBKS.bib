For these cellular automata we construct a countable number of constants of motion using standard spectral techniques and we perform numerical experiments showing interesting dynamical features and particle content. In the second part of the paper we introduce other cellular automata characterized by a very rich particle content and by the existence of constants of motion. },

No physical measurement can be performed with infinite precision. This leaves a loophole in the standard no{\textendash}go arguments against non{\textendash}contextual hidden variables. All such arguments rely on choosing special sets of quantum{\textendash}mechanical observables with measurement outcomes that cannot be simulated non{\textendash}contextually. As a consequence, these arguments do not exclude the hypothesis that the class of physical measurements in fact corresponds to a dense subset of all theoretically possible measurements with outcomes and quantum probabilities that can be recovered from a non{\textendash}contextual hidden{\textendash}variable model. We show here by explicit construction that there are indeed such non{\textendash}contextual hidden{\textendash}variable models, both for projection{\textendash}valued and positive{\textendash}operator{\textendash}valued measurements.

  Abstract                 = {We explore finite-field frameworks for quantum theory and quantum computation. The simplest theory, defined over unrestricted finite fields, is unnaturally strong. A second framework employs only finite fields with no solution to x 2 + 1 = 0, and thus permits an elegant complex representation of the extended field by adjoining ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/47/11/115305/jpa485335ieqn1.gif] {${\rm i}=\sqrt{-1}$} . Quantum theories over these fields recover much of the structure of conventional quantum theory except for the condition that vanishing inner products arise only from null states; unnaturally strong computational power may still occur. Finally, we are led to consider one more framework, with further restrictions on the finite fields, that recovers a local transitive order and a locally-consistent notion of inner product with a new notion of cardinal probability . In this framework, conventional quantum mechanics and quantum computation emerge locally (though not globally) as the size of the underlying field increases. Interestingly, the framework allows one to choose separate finite fields for system description and for measurement: the size of the first field quantifies the resources needed to describe the system and the size of the second quantifies the resources used by the observer. This resource-based perspective potentially provides insights into quantitative measures for actual computational power, the complexity of quantum system definition and evolution, and the independent question of the cost of the measurement process.},

  Abstract                 = {Information is inevitably tied to a physical representation and therefore to restrictions and possibilities related to the laws of physics and the parts available in the universe. Quantum mechanical superpositions of information bearing states can be used, and the real utility of that needs to be understood. Quantum parallelism in computation is one possibility and will be assessed pessimistically. The energy dissipation requirements of computation, of measurement and of the communications link are discussed. The insights gained from the analysis of computation has caused a reappraisal of the perceived wisdom in the other two fields. A concluding section speculates about the nature of the laws of physics, which are algorithms for the handling of information, and must be executable in our real physical universe. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a discrete model theory similar in structure to ordinary quantum mechanics, but based on a finite field instead of complex amplitudes. The interpretation of this theory involves only the \textquotedblleft{}modal\textquotedblright concepts of possibility and necessity rather than quantitative probability measures. Despite its simplicity, our model theory includes entangled states and has versions of both Bell\textquoteright{}s theorem and the no cloning theorem}

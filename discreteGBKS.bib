  abstract    = {In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies with time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus, techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one may impair performance. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the system. The tool whose use we advocate is random-set theory (RST): applying this, we derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters comprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive Bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a posteriori probability (APP) density of the unknown user parameters, and use this density to derive optimum detectors. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to interferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore finite-field frameworks for quantum theory and quantum computation. The simplest theory, defined over unrestricted finite fields, is unnaturally strong. A second framework employs only finite fields with no solution to x 2 + 1 = 0, and thus permits an elegant complex representation of the extended field by adjoining ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/47/11/115305/jpa485335ieqn1.gif] {${\rm i}=\sqrt{-1}$} . Quantum theories over these fields recover much of the structure of conventional quantum theory except for the condition that vanishing inner products arise only from null states; unnaturally strong computational power may still occur. Finally, we are led to consider one more framework, with further restrictions on the finite fields, that recovers a local transitive order and a locally-consistent notion of inner product with a new notion of cardinal probability . In this framework, conventional quantum mechanics and quantum computation emerge locally (though not globally) as the size of the underlying field increases. Interestingly, the framework allows one to choose separate finite fields for system description and for measurement: the size of the first field quantifies the resources needed to describe the system and the size of the second quantifies the resources used by the observer. This resource-based perspective potentially provides insights into quantitative measures for actual computational power, the complexity of quantum system definition and evolution, and the independent question of the cost of the measurement process.},

  Abstract                 = {Information is inevitably tied to a physical representation and therefore to restrictions and possibilities related to the laws of physics and the parts available in the universe. Quantum mechanical superpositions of information bearing states can be used, and the real utility of that needs to be understood. Quantum parallelism in computation is one possibility and will be assessed pessimistically. The energy dissipation requirements of computation, of measurement and of the communications link are discussed. The insights gained from the analysis of computation has caused a reappraisal of the perceived wisdom in the other two fields. A concluding section speculates about the nature of the laws of physics, which are algorithms for the handling of information, and must be executable in our real physical universe. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a discrete model theory similar in structure to ordinary quantum mechanics, but based on a finite field instead of complex amplitudes. The interpretation of this theory involves only the \textquotedblleft{}modal\textquotedblright concepts of possibility and necessity rather than quantitative probability measures. Despite its simplicity, our model theory includes entangled states and has versions of both Bell\textquoteright{}s theorem and the no cloning theorem}

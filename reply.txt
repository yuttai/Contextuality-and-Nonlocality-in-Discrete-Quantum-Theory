The KS theorem states that there does not exist a 0-deterministic QIVPM. We further claim that there cannot exist any delta-deterministic QIVPM for delta < 1/3 and that there exist QIVPMs for every delta >= 1/3 .

The referee questions the correctness of the theorem and the physical interpretation of delta-determinism. The argument against delta-determinism by the referee assumes that the parameter delta is somehow related to the density of the points on the Bloch sphere. However this is not the case, the parameter delta reflects insufficient knowledge of the experimenter which could be due to a variety of reasons like device imperfections etc. 

The following argument shows a concrete but simplified situation which explains the physical significance of the parameter delta. We then follow this explanation by providing experimental results for a 3-dimensional quantum system which cannot be described by any delta-deterministic QIVPM for delta < 1/3 but can be described by a 1/3-deterministic QIVPM.

The meaning of delta: To determine the probability of any event, we typically repeat an experiment n times and count the number of times we witness the event. This assumes that for each run of the experiment we can determine, using our apparatuses, whether the event occurred or not. Assume an event has an ideal mathematical probability of 1/4, and we repeat the experiment 100 times. In a perfect world we should observe the event 25 times and refute it 75 times. (Or we could observe it 24 times and refute it 76 times. This does not matter for the argument to follow.) Indeed what happens if we observe the event 23 times, refute it 75 times, and are uncertain 2 times? This is quite common in actual experiments. Mathematically we can model this idea by stating that the probability of the event is in the range [0.23,0.25] as the two missing records could either be evidence for the event or against it. The parameter delta bounds such intervals of uncertainty. 
\yutsung{This explanation is related to delta, but delta actually quantifies how close an event is to certain or impossible. For example, no matter whether we observe the event 23 or 25 times, as long as we refute it 75 times, delta >= 0.25 because they are as close as to impossible to each other. On the other hand, when we observe the event 24 times and refute it 76 times, delta >= 0.24 since it is closer to impossible than the previous case.}

Now consider a 3-dimensional Hilbert space and an experiment repeated 12 times. By the KS theorem, it is impossible to build a probability measure that maps every projection to either 0=0/12 or 1=12/12.  Now consider what happens if 1/4 of the data for every one-dimensional projector P is missing yielding the following probability measure as a possible formalization:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [0,1/4]     -- these are 1-dimensional projectors
mu(1-P) = [3/4,1]  -- these are 2-dimensional projectors

Indeed for every 1-dimensional projector, the missing data could either refute or support the associated event.  This measure does not satisfy the axioms of probability measures and cannot be extended to any valid QIVPM. In particular for any two one-dimensional events P0 and P1, we have mu(P0)+mu(P1)=[0,1/2] but mu(P0+P1)=[3/4,1] because the latter is a two-dimensional event. This violates the condition that mu(P0+P1) is a subset of mu(P0)+mu(P1).

The situation changes sharply if the missing data reaches 1/3, which gives the following probability measure as a possible formalization:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [0,1/3] 
mu(1-P) = [2/3,1]

This is not a valid probability measure for the same argument as above. However, it might be the case that the missing data for 1-dimensional projectors always support the associated event while those for 2-dimensional projectors always refute the event. In this case, the same experimental data is consistent with the following probability measure:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [1/3,1/3]
mu(1-P) = [2/3,2/3]

which can be varified as a valid QIVPM easily.

Similar situation appears to the Mermin-Peres ``magic square''.  If enough experimental records are missing, there exists a probability measure consistent with the experimental records even if the presented experimental records are always the same.  We consider a two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hilbert space
$\Hilb=\Hilb_1\otimes\Hilb_2$ of dimension $d=4$. We use the same nine
observables $\mathbf{O}_{ij}$ with $i$ and $j$ ranging over
$\{0,1,2\}$ from the Mermin-Peres ``magic square''.  The observables are constructed using the Pauli matrices
$\left\{ \mathbb{1},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y},\sigma_{z}\right\}$ whose
eigenvalues are all either~$1$ or $-1$.  Assume we measure these observables twice.  By the KS theorem, the following measurement results is impossible because the number of expectation values in the $j=2$ column is odd.

		Trial 1		Trial 2
O_00	-1			-1
O_01	-1			-1
O_02	1			1
O_10	-1			-1
O_11	-1			-1
O_12	1			1
O_20	1			1
O_21	1			1
O_22	1			1

However, if half of the records are missing, i.e., delta=1/2, we might get the following measurement results.

		Trial 1		Trial 2		Missing Record Might Be
O_00	-1			Missing		1
O_01	Missing		-1			1
O_02	1			Missing		-1
O_10	Missing		-1			1
O_11	-1			Missing		1
O_12	Missing		1			-1
O_20	1			Missing		-1
O_21	Missing		1			-1
O_22	1			Missing		-1

Since the expreimental results are missing, it might come form the third column.  In this kind of situation, the expectation values of each observables are always 0, and the product relations among these the expectation values must be consistent with the the product relations among observables.  

Notice that we need more experimental results when considering the Mermin-Peres ``magic square'' example.  The rason is that in a four-dimensional Hilbert space, we know a 1/2-deterministic QIVPMs, but we don't know whether there exists a delta-deterministic QIVPM for 1/3 <= delta < 1/2 .

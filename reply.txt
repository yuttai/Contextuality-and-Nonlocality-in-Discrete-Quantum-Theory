In our QIVPM framework, the Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem is equivalent to stating that there does not exist a (delta=)0-deterministic QIVPM. We further claim that there cannot exist any delta-deterministic QIVPM for delta < 1/3 and that there exist QIVPMs for every delta >= 1/3.

The referee questions the correctness of the theorem and the physical interpretation of delta-determinism. In answer to the question of correctness we attach the complete proof of our theorem which we verified again. In the next paragraphs, we explain the physical interpretation of delta-determinism and provide examples that illustrate why 1/3 is special.

We understand that the argument against delta-determinism by the referee assumes that the parameter delta is *exclusively* related to the density of points (states) defining a general Hilbert space. This is indeed Meyer's great insight and main assumption in his proof about the field of rationals nullifying the KS theorem.  In other words, Meyer attributes finite-precision errors to the description of the states. We, however, make no particular assumptions about the description of the states, and attribute finite-precision errors to the measurement process itself as realized in a laboratory. In our framework, the parameter delta reflects insufficient knowledge of the experimenter which could be due to a variety of reasons related to imperfections of devices. A typical question that an experimenter may not be able to answer accurately would be "did an electron land to the left or to the right of the screen"? There are cases in which the electron would land too close to the middle of the screen for the experimenter to be able to determine with certainty if that is closer to the left or the right. That imprecision might be modeled by limiting the description of the quantum states to rational points but we do not make this assumption. We simply record this imprecision in the probability we assign to events and use the axioms of probability theory (additivity, etc) to argue that a sharp transition occurs when the imprecisions reach a certain value. 

The following argument shows a concrete but simplified situation which explains the physical significance of the parameter delta. We then follow this explanation by providing experimental results for a 3-dimensional quantum system which cannot be described by any delta-deterministic QIVPM for delta < 1/3 but can be described by a 1/3-deterministic QIVPM.

The meaning of delta: To determine the probability of any event, we typically repeat an experiment n times and count the number of times we witness the event. This assumes that for each run of the experiment we can determine, using our apparatuses, whether the event occurred or not. Assume an event has an ideal mathematical probability of 0, and we repeat the experiment 100 times. In a perfect world we should be able to refute the event 100 times and calculate that the probability is 0. We might also observe the event 2 times and refute it 98 times and therefore calculate the probability to be 0.02. This situation still assumes perfect measurement conditions however. The question we focus on is what happens if we are only able to refute it 97 times and are uncertain 3 times? This is quite common in actual experiments. Mathematically we can model this idea by stating that the probability of the event is in the range [0,0.03] which says that the probability of the event could be 0, 0.01, 0.02, or 0.03 as each the three missing records could either be evidence for the event or against it. We just can't nail it down given the current experimental results and therefore use a delta=0.03-deterministic probability measure. The interesting observation is that the axioms of probability theory (like additivity and convexity) impose enough constraints on the structure of probability measures that make them robust in the face of small deltas.

To see this in detail, consider a 3-dimensional Hilbert space and an experiment repeated 12 times. By the KS theorem, it is impossible to build a probability measure that maps every projection to either 0=0/12 or 1=12/12.  Now consider what happens if 1/4 of the data for every one-dimensional projector P is missing yielding the following probability measure as a possible formalization:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [0,1/4]     -- these are 1-dimensional projectors
mu(1-P) = [3/4,1]  -- these are 2-dimensional projectors

Indeed for every 1-dimensional projector, the missing data could either refute or support the associated event.  This measure does not satisfy the axioms of probability measures and cannot be extended to any valid QIVPM. In particular for any two one-dimensional events P0 and P1, we have mu(P0)+mu(P1)=[0,1/2] but mu(P0+P1)=[3/4,1] because the latter is a two-dimensional event. This violates the condition that mu(P0+P1) is a subset of mu(P0)+mu(P1).

The situation changes sharply if the missing data reaches 1/3, which gives the following probability measure as a possible formalization:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [0,1/3] 
mu(1-P) = [2/3,1]

This is not a valid probability measure for the same argument as above. However, it might be the case that the missing data for 1-dimensional projectors always support the associated event while those for 2-dimensional projectors always refute the event. In this case, the same experimental data is consistent with the following probability measure:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [1/3,1/3]
mu(1-P) = [2/3,2/3]

which can be easily verified to be a valid QIVPM.

Similar situation appears to the Mermin-Peres ``magic square''.  If enough experimental records are missing, there exists a probability measure consistent with the experimental records even if the presented experimental records are always the same.  We consider a two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hilbert space
$\Hilb=\Hilb_1\otimes\Hilb_2$ of dimension $d=4$. We use the same nine
observables $\mathbf{O}_{ij}$ with $i$ and $j$ ranging over
$\{0,1,2\}$ from the Mermin-Peres ``magic square''.  The observables are constructed using the Pauli matrices
$\left\{ \mathbb{1},\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y},\sigma_{z}\right\}$ whose
eigenvalues are all either~$1$ or $-1$.  Assume we measure these observables twice.  By the KS theorem, the following measurement results is impossible because the number of expectation values in the $j=2$ column is odd.

		Trial 1		Trial 2
O_00	-1			-1
O_01	-1			-1
O_02	1			1
O_10	-1			-1
O_11	-1			-1
O_12	1			1
O_20	1			1
O_21	1			1
O_22	1			1

However, if half of the records are missing, i.e., delta=1/2, we might get the following measurement results.

		Trial 1		Trial 2		Missing Record Might Be
O_00	-1			Missing		1
O_01	Missing		-1			1
O_02	1			Missing		-1
O_10	Missing		-1			1
O_11	-1			Missing		1
O_12	Missing		1			-1
O_20	1			Missing		-1
O_21	Missing		1			-1
O_22	1			Missing		-1

Since the expreimental results are missing, it might come form the third column.  In this kind of situation, the expectation values of each observables are always 0, and the product relations among these the expectation values must be consistent with the the product relations among observables.  

Notice that we need more experimental results when considering the Mermin-Peres ``magic square'' example.  The rason is that in a four-dimensional Hilbert space, we know a 1/2-deterministic QIVPMs, but we don't know whether there exists a delta-deterministic QIVPM for 1/3 <= delta < 1/2 .

KS theorem states that there does not exist a 0-deterministic QIVPM. We further claim that there cannot exist any delta-deterministic QIVPM for delta < 1/3 and that there exist QIVPMs for every delta >= 1/3

The referee questions the correctness of the theorem and the physical interpretation of delta-determinism. The argument against delta-determinism by the referee assumes that the parameter delta is somehow related to the density of the points on the Bloch sphere. However this is not the case, the parameter delta reflects insufficient knowledge of the experimenter which could be due to a variety of reasons like device imperfections etc. 

The following argument shows a concrete but simplified situation which explains the physical significance of the parameter delta. We then follow this explanation by providing experimental results for a 3 dimensional quantum system which cannot be described by a any delta-deterministic QIVPM for delta < 1/3 but can be described by a 1/3-deterministic QIVPM.

The meaning of delta: To determine the probability of any event, we typically repeat an experiment n times and count the number of times we witness the event. Assume an event has an ideal mathematical probability of 1/4, and we repeat the experiment 100 times. In a perfect world we should observe the event 25 times but it is certainly possible (and common in actual experiments) to only observe the event, say 23 times, because in the case of 2 experiments, the accuracy of the devices was not sharp enough to determine with confidence whether the event happened or not. Mathematically we can model this idea by stating that the probability of the event is in the range [0.21,0.25] as the two missing records could either be evidence for the event or against it.

Now consider a 3 dimensional Hilbert space and an experiment repeated 12 times. By the KS theorem, it is impossible to build a probability measure that maps every projection to either 0/12 or 12/12. Now consider what happens if 1/4 of the data for every one dimensional projector P is missing. We might want to describe the result using the following measure:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [0,1/4]
mu(1-P) = [3/4,1]

But unfortunately this measure does not satisfy the axioms of probability measures. In particular for any two one dimensional events P0 and P1, we have mu(P0)+mu(P1)=[0,1/2] but mu(P0+P1)=[3/4,1] because the latter is a two dimensional event. This violates the condition that mu(P0+P1) is a subset of mu(P0)+mu(P1).

If the missing data reaches 1/3, then we get:

mu(0) = [0,0]
mu(1) = [1,1]

mu(P) = [0,1/3] 
mu(1-P) = [2/3,1]

 Yet, for centuries, the mathematical formalization of such processes has
 been founded on the infinitely precise real or complex numbers

 Our purpose here is to exploit the consequences of replacing infinitely-specifi
ed quantum probabilities by finite number of intervals used in interval-valued
 probability measures

(IVPM); in particular, we show that a quantum IVPM may not be induced by
 a infinitely-precise state, but it might be more and more likely to be
 identified to a particular state when the measurement resources increase.

Indeed, almost every description of quantum mechanics, quantum computation,
 or quantum experiments refers to entities such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rme$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 From a computational perspective, such numbers do not exist in their entirety

 For example, the state of the art algorithms for computing the

 In other words, simply referring to the

\end_inset

th digit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 requires more and more resources as 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 gets larger.
 Taking such resource bounds into consideration is what founded computer
 science as a discipline and is crucial for understanding the very nature
 of computation and, following Feynman

\begin_layout Standard
We have been revisiting quantum mechanics, quantum information, and quantum
 computation from this resource-aware perspective.
 Our initial results in that domain showed how subtle the issues can be

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

: a straightforward replacement of the complex numbers by a finite field
 yields a variant of quantum mechanics in which computationally hard problems
 like UNIQUE-SAT (which decides whether a given Boolean formula is unsatisfiable
 or has exactly one satisfying assignment

) can be deterministically solved in constant time.
 To eliminate such unrealistic theories requires delicate analysis of the
 structure of the Hilbert space, the process of observation, and the notion
 of probability teasing apart their reliance on the infinitely precise real
 numbers

In this paper, we shift focus from the infinitely-specified but not directly
 observable quantum states, to observable measurable properties of quantum
 systems and their probabilities.
 Furthermore, we insist that our theories of measurement and probability
 only refer to finitely communicable evidence within feasible computational
 bounds.
 It follows that states, observations, and probabilities all become 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fuzzy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e., specified by intervals of confidence that can only increase in precision
 if the available resources increase proportionally.
 Our notion of

 is related to existing work

 but, as will be explained in more detail, is distinguished by its unique
 computational character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will begin by reviewing existing work that recasts classical probability
 spaces in a resource-aware setting and move to aim at recasting quantum
 probability and quantum measurement.
 In particular, we develop a measurement framework based on quantum IVPM.
 Surprisingly, we found a quantum IVPM which can not be induced by a state,
 while Shapley proved a classical convex IVPM can always be induced by a
 classical

state

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 can always be induced by a quantum state

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

.
 Nevertheless, a quantum IVPM could still correspond to many possible states
 if it is broken into pieces.
 Our examples also suggest that a quantum IVPM could be more and more likely
 induced by a state while the intervals become sharper, i.e., the measurement
 resources increase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Gleason's theorem supports the idea of von Neumann to define a state
 as a density matrix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Varadarajan2008"

, a density matrix might not be a adequate imprecise quantum state.
 Instead, a imprecise quantum state might be more like an interactive system
 suggested by Quantum Bayesianism or QBism

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which would interact differently with different clients.
 Furthermore, the validity the fundamental theorems of quantum mechanics
 followed up by Gleason's theorem, such as Bell

 Our research then might provide a new insight to the old debate among Meyer,
 Mermin, and others about  whether finite precision measurement would nullify
 the Kochen-Specker theorem or not

 interest and that the sample space is a convenient artifact that allows
 us to treat events as sets obeying the laws of Boolean algebra

[Two-coins experiment]

 Consider an experiment that tosses two coins.
 We have four possible outcomes that constitute the sample space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$
\end_inset

.
 There are 16 total events including the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\{HH,HT\}$
\end_inset

 that the first coin lands heads up, the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\{HT,TH\}$
\end_inset

 that the two coins land on opposite sides, and the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\{HT,TH,TT\}$
\end_inset

 that at least one coin lands tails up.
 Here is a possible probability measure for these events: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{c@{\qquad\qquad}c}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\pmeas(\emptyset) & = & 0\\
\pmeas(\{HH\}) & = & 1/3\\
\pmeas(\{HT\}) & = & 0\\
\pmeas(\{TH\}) & = & 2/3\\
\pmeas(\{TT\}) & = & 0\\
\pmeas(\{HH,HT\}) & = & 1/3\\
\pmeas(\{HH,TH\}) & = & 1\\

It is useful to think that this probability measure is completely determined
 by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the two coins in question and their characteristics, in the sense that
 each pair of coins induces a measure, and each measure must correspond
 to some pair of coins.
 The measure above would be induced by two particular coins such that the
 first coin is twice as likely to land tails up than heads up and the second
 coin is double-headed.
 In a strict computational or experimental setting, one should question
 the reliance of the definition of probability space on the uncountable
 and uncomputable real interval

 This interval includes numbers like 
\begin_inset Formula $0.h_{1}h_{2}h_{3}\ldots$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 1 or 0 depending on whether Turing machine 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{TM}_{i}$
\end_inset

 halts or not.
 Such numbers cannot be computed.
 This interval also includes numbers like 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

 which can only be computed with increasingly large resources as the precision
 increases.
 Therefore, in a resource-aware computational or experimental setting, it
 is more appropriate to consider probability measures that map events to
 a set of elements computable with a fixed set of resources.
 We expand on this observation in the next section and then recall its formaliza
tion using interval-valued probability measures

 Consider an experimental setup consisting of a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 identical needles of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 We throw the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

 needles one needle at a time, and observe the number 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}$
\end_inset

 of needles that cross a line, thus estimating the probability of a needle
 crossing a line to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{M_{c}}{M}$
\end_inset

 crossed a line so the relative frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.472$
\end_inset

 whereas the idealized mathematical probability is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.4774\ldots$
\end_inset

.
 In a larger experiment with

 We see that the observed probability approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2\ell}{\pi h}$
\end_inset

 but only if 
\emph on
larger and larger resources
\emph default
 are expended.
 These resource considerations suggest that it is possible to replace the
 real interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 with rational numbers up to a certain precision related to the particular
 experiment in question.
 There is clearly a connection between the number of needles and the achievable
 precision: in the hypothetical experiment with 3 needles, it is not sensible
 to retain 100 digits in the expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2\ell}{\pi h}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another more subtle assumption of unbounded computational power
 in the experiment.
 We are assuming that we can always determine with certainty whether a needle
 is crossing a line.
 But 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the the floor have thickness, their distance apart is not exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, and the needles' lengths are not all absolutely equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

.
 These perturbations make the events 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fuzzy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thus, in an experiment with limited resources, it is not possible to talk
 about the idealized event that exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}$
\end_inset

 needles cross lines as this would require the most expensive needles built
 to the most precise accuracy, laser precision for drawing lines on the
 floor, and the most powerful microscopes to determine if a needle does
 cross a line.
 Instead we might talk about the event that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}-\delta$
\end_inset

 needles evidently cross lines and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}+\delta'$
\end_inset

 needles plausibly cross lines where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta'$
\end_inset

 are resource-dependent approximations.
 This fuzzy notion of events leads to probabilities being only calculable
 within intervals of confidence reflecting the certainty of events and their
 plausibility.
 This is indeed consistent with published experiments: in an experiment
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $3204$
\end_inset

 needles and the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\ell}{h}=0.6$

 needles clearly crossed a line and

 we would express the probability in this case as the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\frac{1213}{3204},\frac{1224}{3204}\right]$

As motivated above, an event

 may have an interval of probability 
\begin_inset Formula $[l_{1},r_{1}]$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 has an interval of probability 
\begin_inset Formula $[l_{2},r_{2}]$
\end_inset

, what is the interval of probability for the event 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}\cup E_{2}$
\end_inset

? The answer is somewhat subtle: although it is possible to use the sum
 of the intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $[l_{1}+l_{2},r_{1}+r_{2}]$
\end_inset

 as the combined probability, one can find a much tighter interval if informatio
n

 the event (i.e., information about the complement event) is also taken into
 consideration.
 Formally, for a general event 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $[l,r]$
\end_inset

, the evidence that contradicts 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is evidence supporting the complement of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 The complement of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 must therefore have probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1-r,1-l\right]$
\end_inset

 which we abbreviate

 by mapping each numeric value to the smallest sub-interval containing it

\end_inset

Despite the absence of infinitely precise numeric information, the probability
 measure is quite informative: it reveals that the second coin is double-headed
 and that the first coin is biased.
 To understand the 
\begin_inset Formula $\subseteq$
\end_inset

-condition, consider the following calculation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{\mu}(\{HH\})+\bar{\mu}(\{HT\})+\bar{\mu}(\{TH\})+\bar{\mu}(\{TT\}) & = & \imposs+\unlikely+\imposs+\likely\\
 & = & \left[0,0\right]+\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]+\left[0,0\right]+\left[\frac{1}{2},1\right]\\
 & = & \left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

If we were to equate 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\Omega)$
\end_inset

 with the sum of the individual probabilities, we would get that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\Omega)=\left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 However, using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\emptyset)=\imposs$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}\left(\Omega\right)=1-\bar{\mu}\left(\emptyset\right)=\necess=[1,1]$
\end_inset

.
 This interval is tighter and a better estimate for the probability of the
 event 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, and of course it is contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $[\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}]$
\end_inset

.
 However it is only possible to exploit the information about the complement
 when all four events are combined.
 Thus the 
\begin_inset Formula $\subseteq$
\end_inset

-condition allows us to get an estimate for the combined event from each
 of its constituents and then gather more evidence knowing the aggregate
 event.

 However, even in classical situations, the structure of the event space
 is often only partially known and the precise dependence of two events
 on each other cannot, a priori, be determined with certainty.
 In the quantum framework, this partial knowledge is compounded by the fact
 that there exist non-commuting events which cannot happen simultaneously.
 To accommodate these more complex situations, conventional approaches to
 quantum probability abandon the sample space
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 and reason directly about events which are generalized from plain sets
 to projection operators.
 A quantum probability space therefore consists of just two components:
 a set of events 
\begin_inset Formula $\qevents$
\end_inset

 often formalized as projection operators and a probability measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\qevents\rightarrow[0,1]$

 For example, the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{0}$
\end_inset

 indicates that the post-measurement state will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0}$
\end_inset

; the probability of such an event depends on the current state; the event
 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{1}$
\end_inset

 indicates that the post-measurement state will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1}$
\end_inset

; the event

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\ps}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+\ket{1})$

 indicates that the post-measurement state will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\ps}$
\end_inset

; the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{1}=\proj{0}+\proj{1}$
\end_inset

 indicates that the post-measurement state will be a linear combination
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1}$
\end_inset

 and is clearly certain; finally the empty event 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{0}$
\end_inset

 states that the post-measurement state will be the empty state and is impossibl
e.
 As in the classical case, a probability measure is a function that maps
 events to 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 Here is a partial specification of a possible probability measure that
 would be induced by a system whose current state is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\mathbb{0}\right)=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\mathbb{1}\right)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\proj{0}\right)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\proj{1}\right)=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\proj{\ps}\right)=1/2$
\end_inset

, \SpecialChar ldots
.
 Note that, similarly to the classical case, the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{1}$
\end_inset

 is 1 and the probability of collections of orthogonal events (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{0}+\proj{1}$
\end_inset

) is the sum of the individual probabilities.
 A collection of non-orthogonal events (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\proj{\ps}$
\end_inset

) is however not even a valid event.
 In the classical example, we argued that each probability measure is uniquely
 determined by two actual coins.
 A similar (but much more subtle) argument is valid also in the quantum
 case.
 By postulates of quantum mechanics and Gleason's theorem, it turns out
 that for large enough quantum systems, each probability measure is uniquely
 determined by an actual quantum state as discussed next.

Measuring Quantum Probabilities

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to the classical case, it is possible to estimate quantum probabilitie
s by utilizing the frequentist approach of the previous section, assuming
 identical measurements conditions in each repeated experiment

 For instance, if one wants to determine the probability that the spin of
 a given silver atom is 
\begin_inset Formula $+\hbar/2$
\end_inset

, a Stern-Gerlach apparatus is built where ideally an inhomogeneous magnetic
 field is generated along, let's say, the quantization axis 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 One then produces a collimated beam of identically prepared (neutral) silver
 atoms that is directed between the poles of the magnet where a predetermined
 field-gradient along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 direction has been established.
 Under appropriate experimental conditions we will observe that the beam,
 after traversing the magnetic-field region, will be deflected towards two
 regions identified by distinguished spots on a detector situated behind
 the apparatus

 Each of the two discrete values is associated to either 
\begin_inset Formula $+\hbar/2$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hbar/2$

, commonly called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spin up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spin down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, respectively.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

counting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the number of atoms that are deflected in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spin up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 region one can, in principle, estimate the probability that the prepared
 state of the silver atom state has spin 
\begin_inset Formula $+\hbar/2$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that a real experiment does not necessarily represent an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ideal measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For example, not all silver atoms will be identically prepared, or the
 field-gradient could not be large enough to distinguish between the spin
 up and down situations simply producing a large single blot.
 In other words, the closer we get to an ideal measurement the better we
 determine those probabilities at the cost of significantly increasing the
 number of resources.
 It is not very well appreciated in the literature that Bohr attempted to
 argue against the measurability of the spin of a free electron

 an elegant use of uncertainty relations

) that a Stern-Gerlach experiment could not succeed in establishing the
 spin of an unbound electron because the Lorentz force would blur the detected
 pattern.
 This example illustrates the case of a fundamental physical limitation
 that not even infinite resources could mitigate.

This measure represents the beliefs of an experimenter with no prior knowledge
 about the particular quantum system in question.
 Formally, we can ask: what can we deduce about the state of a quantum system
 given a quantum interval-valued probability measure, i.e., given observations
 done with finite resources.
 In the case the intervals are infinitely precise the question reduces to
 Gleason's theorem which states that the state of the quantum system is
 uniquely determined by the probability measure.
 But surely the less resources are available, the less precise the intervals,
 and the less we expect to know about the state of the system.
 To formally state and answer this question we begin with defining the 
\emph on
core
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
convexity

The core of an interval-valued probability measure is the set of real-valued
 infinitely-precise probability measures it approximates.
 An interval-valued probability measure is convex if whenever certain intervals
 exist then combinations of these intervals must also exist, guaranteeing
 we can add and manipulate probabilities coherently.
 In the classical world, every convex measure has a non-empty core, which
 means that the interval-valued probability measure must approximate at

Looking closely at the example above, we might think that the probability
 measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is induced by the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{2}$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\imposs$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\ket{1}$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})=\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps'})=\imposs$
\end_inset

, or yet we might think it is induced by the mixed state 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\mathbb{1}}{3}$

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}(\proj{\phi})\ne\necess$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\phi}$
\end_inset

.
 Each of these possibilities is compatible with some but not all of the
 observations.
 All is not lost however: if the observations are made more precise, we
 conjecture that some of the inconsistencies disappear.
 A partial proof of this conjecture is the following example which refines
 the previous probability measure by adding more precise intervals.
 It remains to prove that this refined measure is convex, however.

It is straightforward but tedious to check that

\end_inset

 is a quantum interval-valued probability measure.
 Although we have not verified that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is convex, the following argument establishes that is has an empty core.
 Assume there is a real-valued probability measure satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\rho}^{B}(P)\in\bar{\mu}(P)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $P\in\events$
\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\rho}^{B}(\proj{0})\in\bar{\mu}(\proj{0})=\imposs$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\rho}^{B}(\proj{\ps})\in\bar{\mu}(\proj{\ps})=\imposs$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\rho}^{B}(\proj{0})=\mu_{\rho}^{B}(\proj{\ps})=0$

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\rho}^{B}=\mu_{\ket{2}}^{B}$

In general, we conjecture that if the measurement equipment is made more

 In the limit case,

 we do indeed recover the conventional Gleason's theorem and the Born rule.

Conclusion and Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we insist that probabilities cannot be computed to infinite precision
 and are bound to be approximations represented by intervals of confidence,
 then quantum states themselves can only be discussed within intervals of
 confidence.
 Despite the fact that classically a IVPM could always correspond to a real-valu
ed probability measure, we found that there may be no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 infinitely-precise quantum state approximated by a quantum IVPM as a whole.
 However, if a quantum IVPM is decomposed into pieces, each piece might
 still be induced by a quantum state.
 Moreover, our examples and Gleason's theorem summarized in table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table_long"

\end_inset

 suggests that as the measurement resources increase, an entire quantum
 IVPM could more and more likely be identified to a particular state.

Although we discussed how a quantum IVPM could be induced from a real quantum

 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 entity that exists independently of measurements and probabilities.
 The possibility of no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 underlying state is consistent with the elegantly recent work on Quantum
 Bayesianism or QBism

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Fuchs2010,VonBaeyer2016,Fuchs2012"

, which suggests that the quantum state is more like an interactive system
 in computer science parlance.
 In another word, the quantum state is subjective: each observer has a different
 view of the quantum system that is consistent with their previous observations
 and that allows that observer, independently of other observers, to assign
 beliefs (i.e., probabilities) to possible future interactions.

 In another word, if

 for some pure state
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\phi}\parallel\left(\ket{\psi_{0}}\times\ket{\psi_{1}}\right)$

 For example, example
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}\left(\ket{\psi}\right)=\iota\left(f_{\phi}^{B}\left(\ket{\psi}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 is also in this case when the core is the singleton set

\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ket{\psi_{0}}\times\ket{\psi_{1}}\right)\nparallel\left(\ket{\psi_{0}'}\times\ket{\psi_{1}'}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\psi_{0}'}\times\ket{\psi_{1}'}$

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

.
 However, neither 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\psi_{0}\times\psi_{1}}^{B}$
\end_inset

 nor 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\psi_{0}'\times\psi_{1}'}^{B}$
\end_inset

 is in the core of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\psi_{0}\times\psi_{1}}^{B}$
\end_inset

 is inconsistent with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}\left(\ket{\psi_{0}'}\right)=\bar{f}\left(\ket{\psi_{1}'}\right)=\imposs$

 is inconsistent with

\end_inset

.
 Actually, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 has an empty core, and this is the case for example

In summary, if we have an idea of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 has a non-empty core, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 must be in the above case 1 - 3 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)\cap S^{2}$
\end_inset

 contains no area in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

Notice that we only discuss the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In general, we could discuss the whole 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)\subseteq\mathbb{C}S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, restricting to 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 enable us to visualize and imagine easily.
 Also, if a interval-valued frame function
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 has an empty core when restricting to 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 has an empty core on the original space as well.
 So restricting to 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 still provides some valid results.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In contrast, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)\cap S^{2}$
\end_inset

 contains some area in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

, it must be the situation of case 4, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 has an empty core.
 Furthermore, the larger the area, the more state vectors which are inconsistent
 with any particular Born rule frame function.
 Therefore, the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)\cap S^{2}$
\end_inset

 could indicate how much 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 deviate from the Born rule frame functions.
 In the following paragraphs, we will establish that if the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)\cap S^{2}$
\end_inset

 is big, then the interval
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{I}$
\end_inset

 must be coarse.
 Therefore, if the interval
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{I}$
\end_inset

 is finer, then the area of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}^{-1}\left(\imposs\right)\cap S^{2}$
\end_inset

 would be smaller so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{f}$
\end_inset

 is closer to a Born rule frame function.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to simplify the discussion, consider the center of
